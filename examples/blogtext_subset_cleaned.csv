(Did a little spell-checking and some minor edits too.) Stolen from and reformatted the HTML. It now validates to XHTML 1.0 Strict. How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction. Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma where Karen Silkwood worked was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: • While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. • Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. • If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem. Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges one on each side of the casing go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy. Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed. Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal). Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.) Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer no matter how small can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership! Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2. I subscribe to one or more of the following: Soldier of Fortune, Hustler, Popular Mechanics, Self. 3. Though I have many interesting acquaintances, I am my own best friend. 4. I know what to say after you say 'Hello,' but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation. 5. I have seen the movie 'The Deer Hunter' more than once. 6. I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to, and I resent whiners. 7. I own one or more of the following: handgun, video game, trash compactor, snowmobile. 8. I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic. 9. I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent. 10. I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy. Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had. Enjoy your H-Bomb!"

So, without further ado here is the link to 24-hour K-Pop audio and the video streaming. Enjoy."
5,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning. We were talking about where Koreans put their money. Invariably, they have a lot of real estate and cash. (Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts.) The reason? Real estate makes money here. A lot of money. I've seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 10-15% PER YEAR for long stretches, even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis (referred to as the IMF crisis here, although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out). Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 90-99% in 1997 and only modestly recovered, and a local stock market (represented by KOSPI, or their version of the Dow Jones Index) that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1,000 points (it is now about 800 points, see link ) and you can see why real estate makes sense here. But back to the conversation...I noted that here a 'real big' or 'elite' real estate investor has over 6 billion won (about USD 5,000,000, see converter ) in properties. Dad seemed a little flabbergasted. 'What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for? They don't need that much to retire.' Maybe so, but there is a lot of risk here too. Take real estate (or any other South Korean asset) for example: if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5,000,000 USD is worth about 5 cents. Also, all of it is denominated in won which, during the 'IMF Crisis', dropped about 50% vis-a-vis the USD. Also, if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scam the latest here was the Good Morning City project you're toast. I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it. Her comment (between the tears): 'Now I know what it's like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day.' If you have one of those, some saber-rattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out. The government has almost zero help for unemployed, disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers. The role of family is more important here...so if you have money you should help your family, and if you don't then you should go to them first. Thus the idea that more is more. Koreans go all out in most things they do, and investing is no different. Why have one apartment when you can have 7? The jeonse system supports this as well. You see, if you have a 400,000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea (neither of which are the Western ones, except in rare circumstances). 1. Renter signs a 2-year contract and deposits about half the market value (200,000 USD) with the owner. No monthly rent is paid, but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 4-5% per year. That's a monthly rent/return of $750. At the end of the term the 200,000 USD is returned to the renter. 2. Renter signs a 1-year or 2-year contract and deposits about 10%-20% of the market value of the property (10,000-20,000 USD) plus some monthly rent of $400-$600 a month. In both cases, if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be topped-up or partially refunded. (Of course I'm using USD in this to save my '0' key and to help 'foreigners' reference it better.) Thus, if you buy a place for $400,000 you can turn around and rent it out and get $200,000 to (if you like) buy another place or whatever. Since there are very, very few mortgages in Korea (kind of a cash society, although there are home-equity lines of credit) the system here is a bit different. The key, of course, is that real estate prices keep going up."
6,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well. In the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle 'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke' (to the tune of 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing') that pretty much summed up the post-Woodstock era so well. It didn't add much to sales, but it was a catchy tune. In Korea Coke's theme is Stop Thinking. Feel it. which pretty much sums up a lot about Korea and Koreans. (Look at how relaxed that couple is, now that they stopped thinking and started feeling.) Of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such, but deep down I think many Koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else. Westerners seem to sublimate this moreso, or at least display it in a different way. Maybe scratch all that...Westerners and Koreans are probably pretty similar, but the context in which we do it is different. Anyways, if you think you're losing it in Korea just repeat to yourself 'Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it.' and everything will be alright."
7,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","If anything, Korea is a country of extremes. Everything here seems fad-based. I think it may come from Korea's history. It has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years, and each time they got independence I imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation. Lately (well, not really lately...in 1945) the Japanese Occupation ended. Then the Korean War occurred from 1950-3. After that there was turmoil, but in 1961 Park Chung Hee took over as dictator/president. He had elections, in which everyone was 'encouraged' to vote, but he was still a dictator. After his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk. President Park did some amazing things in his time, however. He took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization. Japan had stripped Korea of its resources, people and even its language and culture (many buildings and palaces were razed and Japanese was the official language here from 1910-1945) but President Park was determined to change that. He orchestrated the 'Han River Miracle' (the Han River, or Hangang 한강 is the main river in Seoul/Korea) and Korea made terrific strides, if at the expense of some civil liberties. Fastforward to the present, and my point, and we see that Korea is the world's #1 wired nation. More than Canada, Finland and way beyond the U.S.A. There was a craze to have PC방s (PC bangs or rooms) EVERYWHERE in the country. As well, instead of PlayStation-like games where players go against the computer or one or two people, Korean gamers (always the communal types) play online games with hundreds or thousands of others. in typical Korean fashion, gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game...in fact, they may be eliminated. So PCbang owners sold drinks, ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele. It was just a matter of time before someone died, as related in this article . Yes, someone died from being on the PC. People thought he was just sleeping (imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out) but, alas, he was the first known casulty of the Net in Korea, maybe the world. Korea, built on extremes, both good and bad."
8,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","Take a read of this news article from JoongAng Ilbo about North Korea's opinion on the scaling down of troops in Seoul and Korea (specifically, 3,600 troops are heading to Iraq and by the end of 2005 the current total of 37,000 should drop to about 24,500). North blasts U.S. troop cuts North Korea again blasted the United States yesterday for what it calls 'an increase of U.S. defense capabilities' after the planned relocation of 3,600 U.S. troops in South Korea to Iraq. Pyeongyang's state-run television network said the plans were preparations for a second Korean war. 'Even though part of the U.S. ground forces will be transferred to Iraq, instead of causing a capability vacuum, U.S. President Bush is augmenting his war policy against the North,' the broadcast complained. 'The U.S. security commitment [to South Korea] is a commitment for preemptive war against us,' the current affairs commentary said. Ok, let me get this straight...moving troops OUT of South Korea and, further, OUT of the area closest to North Korea (the DMZ, or DeMilitarized Zone) is somehow INCREASING the U.S. defense capabilities in South Korea??? Well, I've read a lot of North Korean propaganda (such as at DPRK.com , check out the DPRK News section) but this one is pretty unreal. And with that I'd like to remind everyone that those in the DPRK (I should tell you that means Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea) are probably very good people, it's just the leadership that seems to be making all the waves (I could be wrong, but I'm not going to go up there and find out). The Korean War from 1950-3 was a brutal event that severed many families...some of whom are now lucky enough to see their aged relatives again (remember, it's been 50+ years) in special reunion projects (albeit only for a few hours before everyone is whisked off to their respective countries). Many, however have or will pass on without ever seeing a sister, brother, child, parent or boy/girlfriend again. We in the West, especially Canada where we've never had a war on our own soil except the War of 1812, could never fully comprehend such things. It really makes your wonder how far one would go to support ideology...I guess we have an idea now."
9,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place. Sometimes, though, one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers...especially the local ones. Here are two examples of how the English version of the Korea Times and that of the JoongAng Ilbo (Daily). The first is pretty straightforward. Korea Times said that 249 people were arrested for forging Korean passports, but JoongAng Ilbo says just 114 were accused. Huh? Another one: JoongAng Ilbo said that S&P is positive on Korean banks (a good thing), while the Korea Times said that S&P was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and medium-sized firms. I have no idea why the simple facts seem to be presented so differently...it can't simply be translation, can it?"

Then the vocabulary starts. Oh no. Then the backwards (to us) sentence structure. Yikes! Luckily there are many options for us slow-witted foreigners to take on the language. Of course I could list them here but this JoongAng article says a lot and there are more resources here . Well, if you're a guy here is some motivation for you: Jeon Ji Hyun (전지현), the latest 20-something (24, actually) star of movies and CFs (I hear this means Commercial Feature, but not positive). I saw her latest movie on Sunday night. It's hard to describe the name...the English version is 'Windstruck' but the Korean version is 여친소 (yeochinso) which is short for 내여자친구를소개합니다 (ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida) or 'I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend'. Surprisingly, both titles make sense. If you like, there is a website (Korean and English, looks quite good, actually) here . The movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times, that info is here . For a list of many of the theatres in Seoul click.... here! Here is a great reason to learn Korean...if I wasn't already married, that is. I went with a few foreigners as well as a local/Korean/National...of course the Korean HAD to take a picture...so I HAVE to put it up here. Here we are after the movie...and before the hof/bar. Update: A bud of mine passed this link on to me. It's 전지현 in a Giordano ad. Apparently it was NOT aired in Korea (nothing XXX about it, it's all about sensibilities of some sort)."

But blogger.com figured it would be more appropriate to call it Year of the Boar/bore...thanks guys. Anyways, you may be wondering how a fat, lazy, smelly Canadian guy born in a little town waaaaaay up north finds himself in a place like Seoul...and Yeouido, no less, where only a handful of foreigners visit, let alone live and work. The culprit is my wife. She is Korean, as you may know, and when I was doing financial consulting in Canada we came across an interesting client. He found us through his wife's (see a pattern here? Korean women rule the men) reading my column in the Vancouver Chosun (Chosun is the name of the last dynasty to rule Korea it was ended by the 1910-1945 Japanese occupation) which you'll find here . It's all in Korean, my email and webpage have changed, though. Anyways, this client is a big guy here in Seoul as well as in Canada and wanted (for some reason) to do something for us...so the next time he went to Seoul we went as well (with our first son, second one wasn't around yet). When we arrived in Seoul for our 2-3 week visit we met his 'godfathers' as he called them. He wasn't mixed up in anything, he just liked the sound of being untouchable. From there we met another guy then another guy and then, the next day, my current CEO. We had what economists call a 'coincidence of wants'. He wanted a foreigner with training and experience in securities and alternative assets and I wanted a guy with the connections to get things done in Seoul. After a week or so of meeting for dinner and such (his English was pretty good and is better now, but my wife did a lot of translation in the first part) he said: 'Don't go back to Canada, stay here and work with me.' Not work for me...with me. That was interesting. I knew he had a more enlightened view than most Korean bosses right then and there. So here I am. It's not perfect, I can't speak a lot of the language and sometimes I almost go nuts here what with the differences in culture and business, but it's not bad at all. I also go home every 2 months or so (my wife had baby #2 in Canada and is still there for a bit longer) which means lots of time in airplanes. I always fly Singapore Air but even then, the prospect of being in the air for 100 hours a year is not all that appealing (ya, that's over 4 DAYS flying, over 1% of the year). I do, however, watch about 20-25 movies a year on the plane, which is cool because Singapore Air has individual monitors with on-demand TV and movies for ALL passengers."

I recently met a couple of finance-types here in Yeouido (which isn't too hard to do, as it's referred to as Korea's Wall Street) who spoke pretty good English (which is a rarity here not only in Yeouido but everywhere in Korea). They had studied outside Korea and deal with international business...but still my brutal Canadian accent made it pretty tough for them to figure out what I was saying sometimes. There was one time that their accent got in the way, though. When we went to the restaurant the guy (Junseok, the gal is named Hye-Kyung) asked: 'Do you like deok?' I wrote it just as I heard it. I thought he meant dog (they eat that here) so I called his bluff and said, 'Sure, let's go! What kind of dog?' 'Oh no, deok, deok!' 'Ya, dog?' 'No, deok,' he said again. Then I figured out that he meant 'duck' and said, 'Oh, &#"

14,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","Here it is, the superfantastic phonebox! Today is a great day. Our lovely officegirl Jung Mi (please no letters, that's what secretaries are called here) went to LG Twins building and got me a new phone. I really needed one on account of (i) my old one was all in Korean...which was fine because I memorized where to go to do things on it...and (ii) the screen kept going blank because I produce copious amounts of sweat when I inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time. Well, after 4 screens at 60,000 won a pop I decided it's time to get a new one...but I may end up breaking this one too. It's soooooo cooooool. It has a little camera which I used to take a picture of the box (of course it took me a while to figure out that I couldn't use it to take a pic of the actual phone). I also took a pic of our lovely officegirl...and then inputted her name and number as well...then ordered up caller ID (something I didn't have before, much to my chagrin). Then I asked her to call me to test it out. Her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone (how cool is that?!?!) and she immediately started panicking and saying, 'Change! Change!' haha, Some Korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them. She did, however, insist that I put the pic on this posting...go figure. This phone really rocks. I can take pictures, email them or send to other phones, and send and receive normal emails too. Also, it has a language converter so everything is finally in English. It's tiny, too...like the size of a fat businesscard. Here she is doing the Korean sign for 'take my picture'. Here is a coworker of mine with the same pose. Why? Why?"
15,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers. I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me. For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought: 2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried 고구마 (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each) The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago. The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years. Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me. Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck. This guy stops in the hotspots and unloads silk and polyester ties on neckwear-hungry salarymen. Here they are: 2 for 5,000 won (USD 4.50)!"

(See JoongAng Ilbo link ) and no wonder...what with Mad Cow Disease and Avian Flu virus going around. The only thing that seems 'safe' is pork. Of course, as you may know, oh-gyup-sal literally means 5 layers of fat...so maybe it's not super healthy. Well, I wasn't that bad, I did do 2 hours of inline skating (as they call it here...rollerblading seems to have a tough time rolling off the Korean tongue) beforehand...but the 오겹살 was drowned by a lovely concoction called 오십세주 (oh-ship-say-joo) which is a 50/50 mix of 백세주 (baek-say-ju, literally: hundred year alcohol) and 소주 (soju, literally: booze) thus the translation of the combined drink is called 50 year alcohol. Intersting, eh?"
17,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"18,June,2004","Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam, and my wife's ears). It seems The Grand Hyatt Hotel's (in Itaewon) J.J. Mahoney's has a reputation for beautiful Korean ladies using it as a place to pick up foreign (likely white) men...even married ones. So, if you're single and looking for a good time check out J.J.'s (just bring a lot of dough, the prices are about two times that of most other Western bars). If you're married...well, that's up to you (you should know that some of the gals on the prowl there are 'ladies for sale' there was well, and the prices are reportedly quite high). If your man is in Seoul and reading this (or otherwise knows the score) better get a polygraph...from what I saw some of those gals are pretty good looking (not that I was looking, of course). Well, that's it for tonight. I gotta take the boy to school tomorrow at like 9AM (which is early for my vacation-time now)."
18,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"17,June,2004","Well, I stand corrected, again. Yesterday I blogged that Coquitlam was an oasis of Whiteness in the sea of Asians that is Vancouver, but oh how I was wrong. We went to the, aptly named, Coquitlam Mall today and put Spencer in the play area with a few other kids. I heard a lady speaking Korean to her boy, then a flock (well, three) ajumas (older Korean ladies) came and sat near us. Later, when we went to the pool, we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are Koreans too. Then on the way back I learned that another two sets of neighbors are Korean as well. They're everywhere! It's actually pretty cool. One thing about Koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community. Get a group of white people (who aren't farmers) together and we seem to be pretty stand-offish...or at least it takes a while to warm up. Koreans, as you may know, refer to each other as sister or brother as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another (as I have seen). This is, I think, quite extraordinary. From first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area 'nuna' or 'older sister, as said by a younger brother' (they have a special word for every family member). Also, since Koreans don't normally take to English all that well (or quickly) they really, really appreciate speaking with someone from home. Thus, the community here is quite tight. So I've still got jetlag...although it's pretty nice not to have to work through it. The boys tend to keep me moving all day, though. Usually I sleep at 3AM or 4AM then get up at 11AM, but it's not a good REM sleep. My best sleep seems to be 1-2 hour naps at 3PM or 7PM. When I wake up from those it's really like getting up in the morning; and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight. My father-in-law thinks I should just adjust 100% in like 2 days, but I'm not sure if I'm built that way. If I need to I can do it, but it's like I'm on vacation here. Besides, I do my work at night anyways, when the kids are asleep (and Seoul is awake). I guess that's it for now. Nothing more profound than this from the day, which is a little sad. I love it here: so clean, peaceful and easy to live; but I kinda miss Seoul too: so dirty, loud and easy to get run down by deliveryboys on motorcycles ."
19,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"16,June,2004","So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam, actually. It's really an interesting place; I used to think it was full of Chinese people (not that there's anything wrong with that, but Vancouver's #1 mother tongue is Mandarin/Cantonese, so you'd assume there'd be tons here). Our area is up on a hill in a little bit of paradise, actually. It has started to remind me of Newport in that show The O.C. (O.C. means Orange County). Well, it isn't full of million dollar homes (but there are a few) but the topography is similar (hills, lots of parks, but no beach) and it's really, really white here. I think the only Koreans I've seen have been family and Ensign Harry Kim on Star Trek: Voyager (ya, still have jetlag...watching anything that hits the screen here). On that note, I think I'm having T.V. overload. Well, with the kids I don't get to see too much of it, but when I do I'm boggled by the 60+ stations (and that's not even satellite!) and all, save one, of them are in ENGLISH! Wow! In Seoul I didn't even bother with cable so all I had was AFN (American Forces Network) (that guy on the homepage is their 6:30 newsanchor...the very reason I like to inline/rollerblade from 6-8PM). Even if you have cable you only get like 2-3 other 'B' movie stations...nothing to write home about. Truth be told, though, AFN has a pretty good lineup and I get to learn all about opsec (operational security) and that the U.S. Army in Korea is looking for E-4s and E-5s (enlisted ranks) to be MPs (Military Police). So if you can handle the G.I. ads AFN is pretty cool. Anyways, I didn't remember so many ads for weight-loss programs, get-rich-quick schemes and fantastic kitchen products, but there they were. Of course in Korea most people are pretty fit and they know the best way to get rich is to marry rich or work hard there are some ads there for kitchen and cleaning product, though, proving that some things truly are universal. One ad that did throw me, though, was one for a 'male enhancement' pill. What?!?!? You take a pill for a bigger willi? One version even had about 30 allusions to 'wood' throughout it. I thought it was a spoof...maybe it was...it was on CNBC during The Dennis Miller Show . If anyone knows, please comment. Ok, back to my time here. We went down to the clubhouse to have a dip (ya, it's a little swanky...but the pool is outside, so it's not super-swanky) and there were some 18-something gals there sunning themselves and gabbing. Man, this is NOT Seoul. For one thing, no one actually tries to get a tan in Korea. They wear Darth Vader-inspired visors to keep out all the rays they can and everyone is totally covered up. Even when exercising Korean have pants, long-sleeves, even suits . Also, two of the three of them were 'plus size'. They weighed like 2-3 TIMES that of a typical Korean gal. (Not that that's a bad thing...it's just differences...please, no flames.) Then you have to think...if they are 18 aren't they still in school? By that I mean, they have not graduated from college. An 18-year old Korean would be in the library or at a DVD bang, at least. Most likely not at a pool (and I hear they're there everyday for hours on end)...what a different lifestyle. Even after school is finished they'd be working or looking for a husband, or both. Let's face it, many Koreans have little time to be idle (I must say, they do take time to drink and go to the sauna, though). Maybe I'm becoming too Korean now, beating up these gals simply for having a little fun. All I know is if they did that in Korea people might think they are R.S. (room salon, or places where men pay women to drink with them, sing with them and...uh...do other things) girls. Maybe that's part of the Korean ideal. Women should study and work and find a husband and if they are 'wasting' their time everyday then they must be of low moral fiber. Hmmmm...there could be something to that. Maybe it's part of the reason why so many Korean gals work their butts off (literally, Korean women are usually devoid of a derriere) and seem to push off their own pleasure in some Calvinist tradition. Korean men seem to support this as it not only support the Confucius ideals that many Koreans follow but makes their place as symbolic leader of the home that much more solid (whether it is deserved or not, and we know that in many Korean homes a strong wife controls more than she advertises)."
20,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"15,June,2004","Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her, because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties. As with most things Korean, mothers go all out...right from before conception to...well, it never stops. Today I got a taste of that. What a day! My 3-year old (Spencer) woke me up at 9AM (which is early seeing as I still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3AM last night). The younger, Winston, was already up, too. My wife and I must have fed these kids like 5-7 times during the day, they just never stop! Spencer and I went to his swimming class. We get a discount on regular swimming since he's enrolled. The gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well...I really had no idea what was happening and said, 'I'm not sure.' She said, in no uncertain terms, that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not. I just said, ok, he is, how much? Let's see $1.30 plus $2.60...$3.90. You've got to be kidding?! You're bent about chun-on? (1,000 won/$1.15)? This would not happen in Seoul. They'd see Spencer and pay HIM to come into there! Anyways, what I did with him in the pool was pretty much what the 'instructor' did as well...but she had 3 kids to handle. I thought he'd be doing lengths or strokes, but I guess not yet. After swimming I got my wife a Starbucks coffee. She loves the stuff, and apparently can't justify to herself to buy herself one...those selfless Korean women, bless their hearts. After I came home there was shopping to do. I volunteered to go (kudos for me and time to think), then I suggested Spencer come too (thought he'd fall asleep in the car, especially after swimming) then thought we might as well all go (the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete). Well, the kids stayed up the whole time and I started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you (I'm usually in Seoul) and it's just you two (her mother and sister were out of town). Good God, these kids didn't sleep until 11PM! Someday they'll make great investment bankers, I mused. To all those out there who are single parents, or even just parents, get yourself a Starbucks...you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold, but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds."
21,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"14,June,2004","My wife posed a strange question to me tonight. Apparently this is the new fad in Korea...men are asked 'if your wife and your mother are drowning (neither can swim) and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose?'. Many men say, 'my mother, because I can always remarry...but I can never replace my mom.' Ok, true enough, but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow I know said, in front of a throng of relatives (including his wife) that he'd save his mom. The wife was not impressed. Let's look at this on a more cultural level for a moment. Much of Korean tradition is based on Confucius' teachings; where younger take care of elder, women take care of men and duty to family is first. Parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education, lifestyle and necessities; children, in turn, are expected to do the same when they have the means. Thus, a man should choose to save his mother, who did everything for him (and perhaps still does) rather than his wife who is a bit of a late-comer. The reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict. A husband's mother often endures a lot from her husband, children, society and her own mother-in-law and, not one to stop the cycle, she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife. She comes to pry into, advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couple's lives under the guise of helping her dear son. With divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately; and now people are getting a little pre-emptive, perhaps, in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions. So, men, if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it (probably your wife) take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can. Just remember, you likely sleep with your wife every night, not your mother."

They have those personal monitors for everyone with on-demand movies, TV shows and games..and some lovely-looking stewardesses, of course. Another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers. I've twice been bumped up to business class (with it's better meals and basically flat sleeper beds...what an experience that is). Once because the travel agent made a mistake and SAI decided they'd make my life a bit easier (hint: if you take the same flight 5-10 times they get to know you, too) and another time my flight was overbooked so I too business to San Francisco and got another one to Vancouver (both covered by SAI) as well as 500 Sing$ (300 USD, 350,000 won) which made for a 40% discount from my ticket price. Anyways, this time I was in line for about 30 minutes (maybe it was longer) and a few times I squatted to relieve my legs a bit. The gal at the counter apologized and put 2 'Solitaire' tags on my bags (will upload pic when I get back to Seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own) that basically put them on par with business class for unloading. Nice. The meals on the flight were good, there were lots of good movies and, as usual, they gave me one of those sleeper masks when I asked for it (in business it's automatic, but if you ask in economy you'll get one). Upon arrival in Vancouver I saw a rare sight, the customs area was packed! A cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to. Not to worry, though, as just as I approached the line they opened another area of inspectors...and in about 10 minutes I was picking up my bags. To top it off my cabbie spoke English (something that eluded me in Seoul and Vancouver much of the time) and we had a pretty cool conversation about life, marriage and cultures. (He too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse you'll meet them...a little wisdom for you single-but-lookings out there.) My phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect. I forgot its charger and extra battery, and already ran down the old one...so that's the only blotch on this trip so far; which ain't too bad. I've decided to start to teach him my limited French...which should keep him on his toes. He's already got some of the accent down when he speaks baby-talk."
23,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"23,June,2004","When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of. Now I know that this parenting thing is pretty tough. The worst thing is they 'tag team' us. For example, one stays up til 3:30AM, the other wakes up at 7AM. One has a nap, and the other gets hungry. And my wife isn't into lots of crap food for them, too...so she is constantly cooking and preparing wonderful delicacies like 'rice brocolli cheese tofu cakes' and 'seaweed and beef soup' sounds great, eh?! Well, the kids like it and I guess it's good for them. When I go back to Seoul I know I'll miss these days (and nights) and start my old routine of 6PM rollerblading and going out to the bars on the weekends (maybe even during the week a bit, as my CFA test is finished for a few months). I know the days will be a little less full without my 3-year old jumping (from the couch) onto my stomache/back/gonads...ah, how can I survive? We will have the webcam and daily phonecalls to make things a bit easier, but it won't be the same. Ug, so tired now...it's past 11PM and I know tomorrow will be busy...and the next day too. My bud of almost 25 years is coming to visit and I'll make the trip to the ferry terminal to pick him up and the new place is now inconveniently 60 minutes from the docks compared to 30 minutes for our old place. No matter, I imagine I'll relish the time alone on a simple car trip."

I use this on blogs that I normally read (once I get better at code I'll actually have them posted on this page too) and find it pretty handy. The last few days have been pretty hectic. Basically in the pool (our complex's or the public one) everyday and running around with the kids and not getting a lot of sleep. My wife and I take turns (one was up til 3AM last night, the other awoke at 7AM)...man, getting back to Seoul and my bachelor pad will be like a vacation no matter how much work I have at the office. There they go again...gotta go."

Here are a few things I will (and will not) miss: Things to miss about Korea: being a celebrity (well, a little one, at least...just for being me); 100 kinds of ice cream at the local convenience store (and all for 500 won/USD 0.40); 7 24-hour convenience stores within a block or two of my place; inlining/rollerblading along the Han River ; bars with no line-ups; bar-hopping to at least 2-4 places in a night; Korean people; not worrying about water on the floor of my fully tiled bathroom ; super-efficient subways ; super-cheap cabs where the subways leave off; no taxes , no tipping ; great food, and seconds for free; alcohol available at any store; eating live octopus (I mean live as in swimming around in a bowl/on a plate on the table); getting free fruit and/or tea and/or coffee and/or sugary drinks after every meal. Things to miss about Canada: no pollution (or not noticeable, at least); good mixed drinks (like Dr. Pepper and Long Island iced teas, although that's changing in Seoul now); our complex's pool just 5 minutes away (and it's usually just us or a few people there); burgers that are not served raw (hellloooooo! heard of e-coli?). Things not to miss about Seoul: drunk guys pissing in the streets at night (well, I am one of them sometimes); people always thinking I'm crazy for not liking tofu; paying like $10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers; having to go to the foreign food section to get my M&Ms. Things not to miss about Canada: line-ups and cover charge at almost every good bar; larger Canadian chicks (hey, no flamings, please); union leaders who think someone should make $20 an hour to pick up trash when Korean 60-year-old men do it in Seoul for like $100 a month; Vancouver rain in the winter...and spring...and fall...and summer; high (14.5%!) sales tax ; tips treated as if they are expected (no matter the service); having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles."

This makes sense because, as Koreans would, they decided not only to change the payment system but also all of the bus color-schemes, routes numbers and routes and even the structure of the roads in some areas of the city (see pic below of a fast lane for buses in one of the worst traffic areas of the city). More in this Korea Times article . Life in the fast lane."

Anyhoo, went out for some drinks last night (yes, Thursday night, a school night, but I really wanted to break this jetlag and I find that going out is one of the most effective, and most fun, ways to do so) at a little place called Han's Sausages near Hong-Ik University (usually referred to as HongDae). So upon ordering the bratwurst and beer I noticed something interesting, the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape. Pretty cool idea, and I had seen it before in another bar in Sinchon (another teen/bar district near HongDae). While out on the town I started to think, 'What are the odds that I know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street?' Likely pretty low, but then I remembered the last night I came here and got a call from an old co-worker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had &#"
28,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"01,July,2004","I've always thought of Seoul's subways as a real joy to be on. They are clean, fast, efficient(more or less) and CHEAP. Buses, on the other hand, are a bit of a mystery to me. I take one bus regularly, but that's it. taxis , however, are plentiful, cheap and (once you know a little Korean) pretty easy to use. Now things are getting a lot easier and logical. As of today (July 1st) rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides. This makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway (this doesn't happen in Vancouver). The new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip. As well, my phone will be able to house my T-Money so I don't need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or 'stored-value' ticket. (It can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon! And carry up to 500,000 won, or about 435USD)There's also a color-coding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier. Unless they have little maps on the buses I think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old, but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a city/district that covers many, many square kms.

Anyways, Seoul is #7 and the first Canadian city is the 'Big Smoke' (as my Dad calls it), Toronto at #89 then my recent/dual hometown of Vancouver at #96 (I suspect it'll rise next year as real estate is on a bit of a tear lately). Thing is, if you have the residence/home thing taken care of (as most teachers do in Korea) then living in Seoul/Korea can be pretty cheap. Of course you can always spend $4,500 USD for a bottle of Macallan 50 year-old whisky at SkyBar , but if you keep your head on straight it's not too bad. Every morning I go to my local 7-11 and have 2 삼각김밥 (sam-gak-gim-bab, literally 3-angled/triangle seaweed and rice) for about 1USD. Today I splurged for a 새우버거 (say-oo/shrimp burger) but the price was still under 2USD. (It's good for dieting too, as my wife near-constantly reminds me, because rice has 1/3rd the fat of bread and likely 1/100th that of a croissant, muffin or bagel.) My lovely breakfast. Shrimp burger and triangle kimbap."

Now I understand taking a snooze in a subway car (they are safer here) or taxi (done that a few times), but on some steps? Well, it happens. I couldn't resist taking a pic of this guy...it was like 6PM and he was already sacked out on the front steps of a building in Sinchon (teen district of Seoul). Notice his jacket is a step or so down from his resting place. Must be nice to be in a virtually crime-free city."

32,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"29,June,2004","I used to cook for myself all the time (making bulggogi, kalbi and even lasagna). Now, however, I'm getting pretty lazy. Food is so good, plentiful and cheap in the restaurants (nevermind that Koeans love to go out to eat so if I did cook a large amount of food about half of it would go to waste anyways) that I've decided not to shop for anything more than noodles and booze. (See photos for the result.) Far from what I expected, I ended up losing weight and spending about the same amount of money, go figure. What a balanced diet I have...noodles and more noodles, tuna, gochoo jang (sauce). My fridge, the oranges are just for show, they've been in there for like 6 weeks. Notice the contents: ketchup, mayo, orange juice (jeju-do) beer, soju, beaksayju, mayshilju, onions."

This place (not a good pic, it was from a taxi with my phone-camera) actually has a fire on the sidewalk right in front of it! The guy is pickin out a red/white-hot brick for the patrons inside. Only in Korea. Fire in the hole!"

Things will be a little weird for a bit (as I take about a week to get over jetlag, unlike some people I know who take about 2 days) so postings may be a little sporatic for a bit. As well, work is getting busier...which is fine my me. It's kind of interesting, actually. At this job we always have something to do (I do the weekly newsletter, research, presentations to clients, and liaise with our foreign partners) but there are definate lulls and busy times. Just before my vacation was a lull, now we're back in the thick of things. Speaking of thick, take a look at this pic. Many days here are like this (although, admittedly, not this brutal). Some are blue-skied, but even then you know that the pollution is there. I left my windows upon when I went home and when I came back there was a thin layer of soot on the floor...hmmmm, that seems real nice, eh? Now I know why my mother-in-law always cleaned the floor every day or so. Apparently Seoul has DOUBLE the amount of particles (I'm assuming 'bad' particles) in its air. Anyone who jogs here is nuts (but I, of course, do inline/rollerblade almost everyday, so I'm no better). Lovely Seoul smog. One problem is the number of cars here, another is the level of industrialization and lack of environmental laws (or enforcement thereof) but there is also the polution that comes over from China (where things, from what I hear, are a lot worse) and the Yellow Wind/Dust that makes its way to our shores once or twice a year. I was in one of these storms a few years ago (I was the only gomer without a surgical mask on) and I felt pretty weird afterward. If you have a respiratory problem things could get ugly."

Didn't get near what I wanted to get done on this trip had planned on heading downtown to see a few buds but couldn't get the time to get away at all. A few friends made the trek up to our place, though, which was cool. It's nice to see friends you've known for 10-20 years after being away for a while. One guy that came up here was a friend of a sister of a friend who is marrying (as soon as he gets the familial blessing) a Korean, so my wife and I gave him the 411 on Koreans and ways to do things. (More on that when I get back to Seoul, and have more time.) Got to go now."
36,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,July,2004","A night out in Korea can seem pretty overwhelming, especially in HongDae, Kangnam Sinchon, Sincheon , Itaewon, Daehak-ro or any of the other major hotspots in town. Hongdae, Sinchon and Daehak-ro make a name for themselves by being close to the major universities; Kangnam is a place for lavishing high-priced liquors and girls on clients; Itaewon is near the US Army base, so it's a haven for GIs and other English-speakers (who seem to have more money than brains sometimes, myself included) and Sincheon is a teen district as well, in the well-to-do area of Songpa-gu. My latest foray was to Daehak-ro (daehak/daehak-kyo means college/university, ro means street). We went to a ddak-kalbi (grilled chicken) place and saw a group of 3 guys whooping it up Korean style (copious amounts of soju and food and louder speaking). One was pretty funny. I don't know if he was doing it for my benefit or to show-off to the Koreans around him (Koreans sometimes show that they know English as a form of one-up-man-ship...it shows they are educated and studied a lot, no matter how brutal the usage). He was saying such things as 'Excuse me, could you calm down?' (actually, he said that A LOT) and 'I'm sorry' and 'Okay!'. I think he was practicing to be a bar bouncer or something. Anyways, these guys got pretty loaded. When one of them was away from the table it looked like the other two were a little amorous (Korean men sometimes hold hands or put their arms around each other, especially after a gallon of soju). I snapped the picture below before we left. 2 guys who really like each other (but they are not gay). Then when we finished walking nature was calling me...but not #1. I took a look into the hwa-jang-shil (bathroom) in the restaurant, but it was a squat-type. Then we came across this theatre (below...oh, and Koreans usually pronounce theatre and Seattle the similarly). It was new so I took a look. Man, that bathroom was spotless maybe it looked so good because I figured that all of the ones in the area were squatters or brutally dirty affairs, as they usually are in smaller, older buildings (man, how do these women do it?). Anyways, that's the tip. Look for the newest, hippest building (especially ones with Western food or themes inside) to find the best W.C. (another way Koreans denote watercloset). Fantaseum Since Korea has millions (ten of millions, likely) of cellphones (handphones, as they call them) you'll find public pay phones only in a few places: the airport, the train/bus stations, major hotels and the subways. (Well, I've seen them on the street sometimes, but not that often, and not when you need one.) phones Another instance of Korean marketing gone bonkers. Red Mango is a major bing-soo (shaved ice garnished with fruit and stuff and then topped with yogurt or ice cream). But the tagline for the firm is a little....well, weird 'Start loving myself!'. When I explain it to people they really get confused. Red Mango Another thing here that's funny is girls wear shirts that say '69', it's a brand here but they are oblivious to the hidden meaning (if you don't know I can't explain it here, this site is family-friendly). Or church-going girls will have a Playboy scrunchie in their hair...not knowing who 'The Hef' is. Koreans also have no idea the multitude of words we have for a part of the male anatomy (so the scene in Austin Powers where they say 'woody, Johnston, boner, balls, willi...) goes over most of their heads. They have one word here for it go-choo (hot pepper), and they're pretty surprised to learn that their word for 'ward' in a city (dong) is also another euphemism for gochoo. And, to cap it off, in the subway there was a guy taking a snooze right on the floor."
37,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,July,2004","Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork). Oh-gyup-sal is a one-up on sam-gyup-sal (three layers of fat porl), so it only makes sense that this land of hyperbole would come up with chun-gyup-sal (1,000 layers of fat pork) and it did. As amazing as it may seem, someone got the great idea of leap-frogging all of the competition and calling what is basically pork chop a name that denotes something a little more superlative. Why not trillion layers of fat pork (jo-gyup-sal)? I have no idea. The sign says '1,000 layers of fat pork'...mmmmmmm. Well, Korea isn't the only place where things get blown out of proportion sometimes, it's just that they do it so well here and we're not used to it. Who can forget the launch of the Gilette Mach 3 ? Yes, that's what I need! Three blades on my face! (Of course they had 'Excel' versions of their Sensor, Mach 3 and ladies' razors, too, as if we needed that little white strip to save from cutting our faces open.) Recently the Schick Quattro came out (for those of you who failed Latin, Italian, Audi or whatever language this is in: quattro means expensive). Now Gillette has a 'power' version of its razor. Now this is getting ridiculous! Here in Korea I get 10 good razors for 2,000 won (USD 1.75). (Yes, 17.5c each!) They're so cheap I only use them twice then throw them away. (Please no Greenpeace/eco-friendly group flamings.) And you know what? I get a pretty good shave out of it, too...similarly I only buy plain ol' pork chops at home."
38,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,July,2004","Sometimes this place really makes me think. So many things are so different here (language, expressions, people, culture, shopping, driving habits) but, yet, some things are just like home. Take my building, for instance, there are a few guards (we call them 아저씨, ajeosshi, or 'mister') in the lobby...well, they're no so much guards as they are greeters, like at Wal-Mart (neat article here ). After they figured I was not a visitor, but a long term resident of Seoul they started saluting me, waving and saying 'Morning'. Huh, morning? Ok, I guess they learned that greeting somewhere. Many Koreans in lower-level jobs know absolutely no English and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten, so I appreciated the effort. Then I was inline skating (rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily) one lovely 4AM and another 아저씨 said 'Morning!'. Ok, that's two. Interesting. Then I got to thinking (well, it came to me while watching a Kia ad) that Morning is everywhere in Korea. This morning (there I go again) I saw a give-away paper called 모닝 (Korean phonetic of morning) and then recalled the ad for Kia's sub-compact car . A simple search on Google Korea came up with more: an online bookstore , an online flowershop , a golf site and a news organization . Then there's Good Morning Shinhan , one of the largest secutities dealers in Korea with its flagship building in Yeouido, one of the largest in town and flaunting its name, albeit in Hanguel/Korean text, for all to see. And, of course, this is the 'Land of the Morning Calm'. I could go on, but you get the point. 'Morning' is not without it's detractors, though. About a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors. One lady summed it up well saying, 'Now I know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day.' Definately not a good morning for her. As an aside, apparently another Western idea is hamburgers, and in NORTH KOREA, no less. (JoongAng Article here .) Here's your factoid for the day: although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original, Korean has incorporated about 10,000 English words into its language; much like Tagalog/Filipino has a lot of Spanish and we Westerners are comfortable with Bon Appetit and Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto."
39,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"07,July,2004","A readers will know, shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada, the US, UK...). For one thing ( more things here ), you can haggle at almost every 'store' (and some for sure at every place that is not a store, but like the picture below). This includes the 'department stores' like Migliore, Doota and Hello ampm that are in Dongdaemoon (each area actually stalls of independent sellers) but not such high class/price places like Shinsegae or Lotte Depart. There is also no haggling at Lotte Mart, LG Mart nor E-Mart, but in those places you're getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores. Anyways, I find that haggling is a bit of an art...and it takes a little while to get the hang of it. After a while you'll wonder why you don't get a discount back home, though. (There is also no tax on purchases; it's either included in the price or just not paid especially at street-sellers.) Like today, I went to Namdaemoon for some shopping, had to get a few undershirts and towels. I found a seller of both and asked the prices: 2,200 won for a shirt, 1,700 won for a towel...no discount. Huh, ya, right. I offered 16,000 (compared to the 16,800 total price...this is NOT a big discount, just 5%, but I was in a hurry and didn't have 5 minutes to haggle for $1.50 off). She said, 'no discount' again, but I said (in Korean) 'I'm buying 3 of these and 6 of these, discount!' and she relented. Oh, it helps if you can do simple math in your head (the seller sure as heck can) and if you know enough Korean to at least say the prices in Korean . Otherwise you're a bit of a mark. Now for this picture. This 'store' popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes. No guarantee, but for $10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares? Get your ladies shoes right here!"
40,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"06,July,2004","Recently I downloaded Go-Stop (a traditional Korean card game, played almost exclusively by men, Yahoo!'s version is here ) to my phone. (There is one called Sexy-Go-Stop too, for those who are into Anime.) Well, I've been playing it (the clean version) so much that my battery dies sometimes when I'm out (is this an addiction?). The last time was out at the movie theatre (the MMC in Dongdaemoon is open 24 hours, if anyone is looking for a flick at 3AM). A friend of mine said they have chargers at convenience stores (I also remember them at some restaurants too). Then we found that they had them at the theatre, too. The young kids there knew how to hook up the battery...they were really helpful, actually. Koreans are so nice sometimes. Here's a pic of what to look for if you're in Korea and your phone goes dead. You stick your battery in here for about 5-10 minutes and it's powered up (but the charge wears down more quickly, I think). More things I like in Korea: delivery services. I ordered a few books from Seoul Selection (a great foreign bookstore that has an interesting newsletter that's worth subscribing to it's free). Anyways I ordered online at 3:00PM. The order showed up at my door at 9:30 the next morning. This would not happen in Canada unless you paid extra for delivery, and even then it'd maybe be 2 nights as I ordered late in the day. Korea, though has a ubiquitous number of quick service delivery services (as they're called). This means it takes about 1-2 hours for a package to get across town because a motorbike courier takes it rather than taking it in a van to a sorting station then another van for delivery. (It's similar to the bike couriers that we have in the West, but no one bikes on the roads here.) I also like the way Korea updates things. The pics below show one example. In the old days there was a rarefied breed of warrior who guarded the main palaces and nobles, today there is another (decidedly more leggy) version. (Um, this is a joke, for those who believe everything they read.) Changing of the Guard and Twirling of the Rifles."
41,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"05,July,2004","One of my favorite places in 여의도 (Yeouido) is Wingswing located on the second floor of the building behind the Lexington (formerly the New Manhattan) Hotel. It's run by the son-in-law of a Korean who spent 20 years in New York and Atlanta running similar places...and now the old man is here to revamp it. They added 2 bar counters and hard liquor (and recipes) as well as more to the menus (spaghetti, quesadillas). Last time I was there I had Crown Royal (oh, how I love it) and the time before they served us this Flaming Dr. Pepper which is a shot of Bacardi 151 in a glass of beer. It's not as tasty as the version I know (Amaretto shot in a 50/50 beer/Coke mix) but not bad. Probably one of the few places in Seoul you can get some of the booze this place has and the only one in Yeouido. Flaming Dr. Pepper at Wingswing"
42,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"04,July,2004","Over the last few weeks I've been to a couple of Western movies ( Troy and Spiderman 2 ) and a few Korean ones as well: 여친소 (Yeochinso/Windstruck) ; 올드보이 (Old Boy) ; 공공의적 (Gong-gong-ui Jock/Public Enemy ; 와일드카드 (Wild Card) ; and 범죄의 재구성 (Beomjwi-ui Jaegooseong/The Big Swindle) . I really liked all of the Korean movies (actually the Western ones seemed pretty predictable compared to the Korean fare) but found it interesting that 4 of the 5 (all but Old Boy) were cop movies. (To be fair, in The Big Swindle it was more about the robbers than the cops still, the theme was intact.) Maybe this is typical to movies in general (going in phases, all of the movies are from the last year) or maybe it's just how (again) in Korea things are very much fads; where once a theme gets started it's difficult to stop it. Public Enemy, WildCard, The Big Swindle and Old Boy With that in mind, I think of my night out on Saturday. A group of friends and I had dinner and a movie in the 동대문 ( Dongdaemoon ) area then headed to 대학로 (pronounced Daehan-ro, but the Korean spelling is Dae-Hak-Ro: Daehak means university, ro is street, so (as you may have guessed) it is a street near universities so, of course, there are tons of bars there). It was raining as a typhoon is in town (see the typhoon tracker page for updates of when one is on its way here) so there weren't many people out on the town. (I, however, didn't mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and I was in shorts a shirt and cut-away sneakers...really quite comfortable.) We went to about 5 places before finding one called 꾼 (Kkoon, an intersting name). The gal running the place said it was their first business day, but the place was empty. The music, however, was really good so I said, 'Service.', as in: what will you give us to come in? She offered plates of snacks and such...sold! The prices were lower than I'm used to, too...a good place. So, how does this connect? The ambiance. The bar was like many other ones out there with tables, low lighting, club music, and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers (we had 8 different kinds). I guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well, in which case you'll have lots of imitators. I wonder what the next trend will be? Whatever it is, it'll catch on fast. (JoongAng Ilbo article on this topic.)"
43,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"14,July,2004","In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians, heads of business) and follow (workers, students). Don't get me wrong, Korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years (thanks mainly to the iron-grip of their president/dictator from 1961 to 1979, Park Chung Hee) and in the last 10 years (when Korea really started to open up to Western influences) but things are still in a state of flux here. Business practices have changed (although they retain much of the old flavour), politics...well, politics seems to still be the same..., relationships between people has changed (albeit only a little, Koreans still follow Confucius tenets and defer to age, men and the learned) and even language has changed (as the Internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words). With these changes comes inefficiencies. One can capitalize on them or be a victim. The lady in the BMW below may have done both. She is likely enjoying the ride in her Z4, but (according to this newspaper article she is also a victim of over-pricing something that BMW, I assume, does not mind as they can have a higher profit. (One other part of this may be that BMW has certain 'import duties' over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here, such is another inefficiency.) The BMW Z4...a pricey car in this town. But what about those who cannot afford a luxury car, a flat in Kangnam (the priciest district in Seoul) and an expense account at the local watering hole? Or worse, those who had it all and then lost it? What happens to them? Well, for some, the answer is suicide (hence my mention of BASE jumping (Buildings, Antennae, Spans and Earth) in the title. Since there are few guns in Korea (heck, many policemen do a Barney Fife and don't even walk around with a loaded gun, the bullets are in their pocket!) the next best thing is jumping. While inline skating one day near the river I saw police taking 2 jumpers from the water ug,that was not cool. Sorry for the imagery. One thing that irks me about Korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters (one faux pas I probably just committed above). We know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides, but they continue to report suicides as they happen. Some of the stories are truly heart-wrenching and I (yes, even I) weep a bit when I hear some of them this is not something you get desensitized to. If you're of strong mind take a look at this article on recent suicides . Of course, it's not just in Korea. In the U.S. military suicide is the #2 killer (I'm not sure if friendly fire or actual action are #1, you start to wonder sometimes). The interesting thing I found from reading all of this (not that it makes me an expert by any means) is that Korea, although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 OECD countries, it was waaaay down the list globally (Korea always wants to be #1 compared to the top nations, which is why they probably used this statistic). Countries in Eastern Europe (although some of these 'suicides' may be underworld related), Scandinavia, and even the US and Canada, Hong Kong and Japan had higher rates than Korea did in 1994. (From Table 1 in this paper/abstract In true Korean fashion, the rates here went from 6.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 16.5 in 2000 and 18.1 in 2002...man, does everything here have a logarithmic curve to it? Some also turn to murder , such as happened 10 years ago and lately again (and I'm sure there were other cases in-between), but that's another story. Perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on."
44,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"13,July,2004","Koreans have an interesting saying when referring to guys like me: 기러기아빠 ( gi-reo-gi a-ppa, wild goose dad). Whenever I told Koreans that I was here and my wife and kids are in Vancouver they would call me this, and now I know why. My boss explained it to me quite well (although he called the bird a seagull , as many Koreans do). It goes like this: a goose flies very high in the sky (so does a vulture, but I guess that's not as poetic, nor as flattering) and has very good eyesight. Therefore, it can see things waaaay in the distance which is good, because that's where a 기러기아빠's family is...across the ocean. It is used for Koreans who go abroad to work, as many do in the Middle East on the many Korean-lead construction projects there, for the many families that have the wife and kids in a foreign place (especially Canada, especially Vancouver...there are so many there) and the dad stays in Seoul, and for guys like me who come to work but whose wife likes Vancouver soooo much she can't bear to live in Seoul and put the children through such torture as is living here. It's just another part of Korea where things that don't make a lot of sense at first seem to be clearer once you get the whole story. The majestic, beautiful Canada goose."
45,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"13,July,2004","This Korea Times Business Section editorial speaks of Jwa Seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the Federation of Korean Industries) 10 mysteries of the Korean economy. #1 Western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the Korean economy. #2 Seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development. #3 The rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities. #4 Income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies. #5 Competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol. #6 Economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power. #7 The exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools. #8 Government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization. #9 The Roh administration seeks to scrap the Park Chung-hee’s economic development model, which created the Miracle on the Han River. #10 The government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness. To this business/economic list I'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern Korean culture, if I may. #1 Koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 Many Korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry Koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (N.I.M.F.T Not In My Family Tree) #3 Everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of Korea. #4 Koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 Korean students hate learning English, but older ones seem to love taking English classes. #6 Even after years of incredible progress Koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the Rodeo Drive of Seoul, the Silicon Valley of Korea, the Harvard of Korea. #7 Most Koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward U.S. soldiers here (especially those who served in KATUSA-Korean Army Training with U.S. Army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave South Korea vulnerable). #8 Koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 Koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 Many Koreans have dogs as pets, but many other Koreans eat dog! Another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. A group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on. The kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they ALL stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks. Unreal. The more things change, the more things stay the same."
46,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"12,July,2004","Paris Lovers...what a happy couple. Looking at Korea one can see something of a Leave it to Beaver mindset when it comes to relationships especially in the minds of 20-something girls here. One could compare it (as I will) to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home. Thankfully, some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume. Recently I watched Hi, Dharma! ( a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery ) and In-eo Gong-ju (literally means mermaid princess, but is translated to My Mother the Mermaid or Little Mermaid; a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love). Dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the (relative) purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters. Both learned that their so-called 'pure' states (of peace or brutality) are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another. The daughter in Mermaid had a revelation as well. She hated her parents (her father seemed a dim-witted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubber/masseuse at a bathhouse). She wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend. An odd occurrence (I still don't know how this happened) put her back in time to when her parents met on Jeju-do where her mother was a diver (mermaid connection) and her father a postman. She comes to see them in their innocence and pure state full of dreams and potential; not the broken and bitter people they became. A picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle, smiling. The daughter asks her mother why he is smiling...and in the last scene her mother says, 'Of course he is smiling, what else could he be doing?' (or words to that effect). Yes, the young have every reason to smile. My Mother the Mermaid and Hi, Dharma! Mermaid seems to show that the 'pure' state of youth and promise is a transient one and Dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good (adding another dimension for growth). This is something that some young people here don't seem to grasp...they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family (which means grandsons for many parents and in-laws). Perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the Kims/Joneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife. Of course, if they don't marry the perfect person Koreans can now get a divorce quite easily...which is another problem."

48,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"23,July,2004","Just so you know, this blog isn't about being political. If anything, it's about as apolitical as you can get for blogging. However, there is something that I wanted to comment on: you can use it to form your views or not. Oh, and I talk about some of the important points in here, so if you're going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later. Last night I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 (click for a local review and a trip to the warroom ). It was a pretty good film. I had seen a few clips from it so I had an idea of what to expect, which was kind of unfortunate. Some said 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and I think knowing that dampened the mood a bit. It may have been better if I didn't know what to expect (and, sorry, now you know kind of what to expect so I opened a bit of Pandora's Box for you too). When getting the required popcorn and drinks (5,000 won, 4.50USD for a large tub and 2 drinks!) I was greeted by this guy (below). I had to say, 'That's quite a get-up you got there', knowing/hoping he wouldn't understand. At the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in. I didn't think about them again until the end of the movie. Soon he'll be wearing a different uniform. Fahrenheit 9/11 was a pretty interesting show. It tweaked a few memories I had from that day. When it happened I was in bed in Vancouver, just waking up. As a stockbroker I was wired to the daily news and had turned on my T.V. at 5:50AM. The news of the first plane was already broken and I was thinking, 'What the heck? Some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world? Was it a terrorist?' When the second one hit I think we all knew that it was no accident. I watched it all that morning. Waiting for the fires to be brought under control; or maybe for another plane to hit another tower. Who could tell what might happen? It was especially surreal for guys like me, I think (egotistical, eh?). My dream, as any guy in finance would have, was to be to be in Windows on the World (the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers) giving a high-powered presentation to the money-men of New York and the world. That dream seemed more like a death sentence now. I don't know what the emotion was, but you might say I was relieved that I didn't go to Wharton or have a CEO dad who might get me into that room on that day. Of course you didn't have to be a financier to be there, many blue-collar people (firefighters and police) and 'regular Joes and Janes' were there as well. The next day I went to work. It was quite odd. There was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harbor-planes were absent. All I could think about was the day before. I still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to Earth so many times in the weeks following. It sure didn't help my spirits. Back to the movie. I knew what Michael Moore was up to when he made this film. His previous works included: Roger & Me (where he went looking for the CEO of GM (Roger Smith) for answers why his hometown of Flint, Michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm) and Bowling for Columbine (where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the Columbine shootings). I saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers (part-timers with no benefits, low salaries, fired for small errors...hmmm sounds like Korea in some ways!). Now, I'm in finance, mostly of the idea that business is good, so even though I found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didn't really change my thinking much. (I think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time.) I knew that Moore would be going after Bush, but I had no idea how much he had on him (or at least how bad he could make him look). Moore's 9/11 was, as a documentary should be, presented as a well-researched, factual and intellectual piece. It went into the histories of the major participants (although not much on Saddam and I was worried about how he said that Iraq never hurt an American: some of it smelled of hyperbole) and presented the facts in logical sequence. Then he threw in a curveball. He had a gal in there (a wife and mother) who, in the beginning, loved the U.S. and the armed forces a lot. She carried her American flag out each day to hang on the front of her house careful NEVER to let it touch the ground. Later, after her son died, she hated what had happened in her country. I'll tell you the worst part was how she was given the news it was OVER THE PHONE! I remember in We Were Soldiers the Army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab (delivered by the drivers, no less) as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job. That, I thought was a low point, but this story plumbed the depths. Clearly, Moore was not trying merely to make President Bush look bad (he made virtually everyone Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice look unprofessional, but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera). He could have easily made the soldiers in Iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone (which, it seems, they did do at times, but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone). No, he went at things on a bit of a different tact. He personified not only the soldiers, but something more identifiable not only for Americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any country's armed services he made a poster child of those who are left behind (temporarily or permanently) when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son. The mother (pictured below) is the real story and storyteller here. President Bush is a major figure, Moore is the one who brought it all together, but its her story that hits home more than any other. No 9/11 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her family's loss. Her husband said it best, though, when he said, 'We are very sad to lose our son in the war, but we are more sad to know that families all over America are having the same thing happen to them right now.' (I'm paraphrasing from my fallible memory, but I think you get the point.) It's the families that suffer(ed) when 800+ troops were killed in Iraq. (We also can't forget the loss of those in WTC, a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in Presidential Briefings.) For some their will to support the President and perhaps America itself may have been broken. I thought of our popcorn-seller (above) and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war, trading one uniform for another. What if my son(s) were sent off without an imminent threat, as we had in WWII and other 'respected' wars? How could you be proud of a country that did that to its children? Who is the main character in Fahrenheit 9/11? President George W. Bush? Michael Moore? or the mother of a fallen soldier? So, what is next? Will there be a sequel in a few years? Perhaps Fahrenheit 38 Degrees? (Meaning the parallel of latitude that splits North and South Korea, and translated to Celsius that's just 3.3 degrees close to freezing, kind of a cold war, which is what we have here: a war, but no open hostilities.) I doubt, after all this, that Bush (or any U.S. President for the next while) has the political muscle to go after North Korea, and that's just fine by me. Heck, if anything happens Seoul is within range of the North's artillery (!), to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne (and if the U.S. says they don't have the capabilities I'm inclined now to think that maybe they do). Some things are different in Korea. For one, the two Koreas are still, technically, at war. Only an armistice (or cessation of open combat) was signed, not a peace treaty. I read the North signed it but the U.S. declined to sign it hearkening to Moore's idea that the military-industrial-political complex needs a 'constant state of high alert and confusion' to reach its aims (which are, mainly, focused on money). I'm going to digress for a little bit here, sorry. Much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war. For instance, the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford that former President Bill Clinton received was founded by Cecil Rhodes : one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time (so much so that the country of Zimbabwe's former name is Rhodesia, named after him). He made him money from exploitation of South African diamond mines a country which was finally conquered by the Boer Dutch in 1902, the same year Rhodes died. As well, the respected Nobel Prize was founded by Alfred Nobel who made his money from a little product he invented: dynamite/T.N.T. A technological triumph that is best known as 'the thing that makes things blow up', as an explosives expert might put it. Back to Korea. Here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves. A recent article reported that 74% of respondent to a survey of Koreans said they believe politicians are law-breakers. Maybe the same is true in the U.S., but 74% pretty much tells you that people here don't need a Michael Moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors. (I'm not sure if that is a good thing.) The difference here, though, is the threat. As I said, there is still a war going on. South Korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an 18-month jail sentence for those who do not comply (of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company, so it's actually more of a life sentence). In the U.S. service is voluntary, it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers, but it is, in the end, voluntary. Those who are in the service and do not want to be (re-)deployed to a place like Iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment. Again, the difference here is North Korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the Koreas and they will take back the South; while Iraq did not make (according to Moore, I'm not sure about this point) threats toward the U.S. North Korea also does not have any resources (something that can't make the economy in that non-trading country very viable). Anyways, this is a record blog length for me, and I'm glad you came along for the ride. My last word is simply that after Moore's 9/11 movie I think many people, myself included, will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars (if I may go so far as that) harder to do in the future...and that, I imagine, was its intent."

One of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls. Ya, you heard right. Girls in cheerleader-like outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort. It's really quite a sight. When my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things...his 20-year-old brain was probably about to overload. This display I saw in Namdaemoon as I did some light shopping (actually I needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat & humidity here these days). Have no idea what this store is, but I was sure tempted to take a look. (Guess the marketing works.) Welcome to the Grand Opening of...um...I forget...where am I anyways? Then we have Bricx , a little place I've walked past but didn't see a reason to enter...maybe now, however. I'm not one for anime usually, but this one... It took me a while to read it correctly. Usually they say things like 'free drinks (upon paying cover of 20,000 won)' or something. I know Ohoo/Hodge Podge has free drinks for ladies on Thursdays from 10-midnight, but this one is a little more interesting. All gals in bikini tops get free drinks at Bricx on that night...hmmmm. I wonder what they'd do if I showed up in my bro/manzeer. Finally, take a look at Seoul Pub's video on 'Picking up in Seoul' on Seoul Scene's website . It's pretty corny...but mostly funny. The Aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there (I mean like every night, which is probably why he's featured so prominently). They've got another one called Bondaegi Challenge in which unsuspecting passer-bys are asked to eat....ready for this?...steamed silkworm larvae. It's actually quite well liked here. UPDATE: I didn't make it to the Bikini Party, but here are some pics taken at it: here and here ."
50,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"21,July,2004","I was going to hold off on writing this until I had a ton of pics of some of the public washrooms they have here, but I had a pretty brutal experience in one today so I figured that was a sign or something. Here's a restroom to avoid: near Line 4 at Seoul Station Subway...unreal. As soon as I walked in I noticed the floor was dirty, which is normally ok, a little dirt isn't the end of the world. Then I noticed a pungent odor...really brutal, actually. If I didn't have to go so bad (#1) I might have bolted, but instead I just let it go...man, did I regret that. I tried breathing through my hanky, but it didn't work, the smell permeated everything. I was getting light-headed from lack of oxygen and barely made it out of there. Man, I think they cleaned that place last when Park Chung Hee was in power (1961-1979). Ugh! Below are some interesting shot. Take special note that they were all taken from the hallway of the building, not inside the restroom. Thus, anyone walking by could not only see the empty stalls (which is a faux pas in the West as it is) but also the user of it if it is occupied. Some also have a fantastic view from outside, just in case you want two audiences. All of these pictures were from the hallway, not inside the actual bathroom! The one below is interesting. This bar in Daehak-ro is the only place you can dance in the whole district (or so its sign says) but it's also the most interesting bathroom. There is a door/window right beside the urinal that opens out to the alley. It lets in a nice breeze, but makes one feel like a bit of an exhibitionist. On the left: that's a door/window that looks into an alley...and anyone can look in. On the right: in Lotte Department Store there is a bathroom manager and worker...posh! Many buildings have bathroom attendants but here they not only have a check-list sheet (as they have in the West in many places) but also the picture of the attendant that cleans it (I guess in case you want to pick them out of a crowd: 'Hey, don't you clean my office's bathroom?') and in the one above there is a 'manager' and attendant responsibile for the cleanliness of the washroom. If only they were at Seoul Station on Line 4's, I might not have almost lost my lunch."
51,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"20,July,2004","Ah, the monsoon season has ended and thus begins the dog days of summer on the peninsula. I promised myself that I'd never be in Korea (and especially in Seoul) for this, but it looks like I'll be here for about half of August. Oh...my....God! It will be so hot. Many Koreans take this hot weather as an opportunity to take time off (what with the continued fazing in of the 5-day workweek here) and have some ice cream (there are so many awesome flavors here, priced from 500-1000 won, or just 0.45-0.90 USD!). Of course Koreans have a penchant for doing the moderately illogical as well. Today the owner of a 한방삼계탕 (han-bang-sam-gye-tang, extra healthy ginseng chicken soup) place ( not this one, but close ) came by the office. I actually was able to use my pitiful Korean to confirm that his place is in the basement of some building and that the price was 8,000 won (7USD, not bad). Then a friend of mine said it must be because we are in 초복 (cho-bok) or the start of the dog days. Anyways, as you may know, Koreans have 2 things they need in life: to be warm and to be well fed. Samgyetang is served literally boiling hot (they even have special stoves to fire up the bowls) so you'd think it's best served in the winter...oh no...Koreans love it best in the summer (as if it's not hot enough!). Well, this is Korea, so I'll likely have a burning bowlfull at lunch with the throngs. (When I asked why Koreans like hot food in the summer the only response was: because it's good for your health.) It'll make the air conditioned office that much more inviting. Oh, and another reason they call it the 'dog days' is they like to also have 보신탕 (boshintang) or dog soup. Yup, they eat dogs here (read story if you've got a strong stomach) . It's the typical Korean food reasons: it's good for men's stamina (as in: stamina between the sheets, the only kind they care about) and for women's skin (gals here are a little preoccupied with good skin). Many guys, especially older ones, and 'talents' (which is what they call any celebrity, star, singer, actor) dine on dog in order to excel in bed or in front of the camera."

Out every night working (here that means having drinks with friends, clients, suppliers and partners (business partners, that is, I'm not into the girlfriend scene). Thus, all I've got today is a link to this other blog . Some funny scenes from the Seoul Subway system. Enjoy. Oh, and as I reported earlier , Bricx Bar had a Bikini Party last Friday. I didn't make it there, but here are some pics taken at it: here and here ."
55,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"29,July,2004","Ok, you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is. It's tenuous, but here goes. First, these are four countries I likely will not drive in (although I did drive in the Philippines, or Phil, but that was in my younger days) the first three because of the amount of nuttiness I've either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because I don't think I'd spend much time away from the beach. Ok, so about this Korean driving stuff. I've been here for almost 2 years and always get the question: 'do you have a car?' My answer, I think, is pretty logical. No, because (i) the subway system here is cheap, easy and pretty fast (no traffic); (ii) the bus system is not prefect, but once you know which one to take it's quite nice; (iii) our firm has a driver and Hyundai Equus for visits on company business; (iv) taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive; (v) my work is like 20 meters from home; and (iv) driving here is not like in Canada (either I'd cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when I drive back home). Thus, no need for a car. Actually, I try to stay off the roads whenever possible here. Perhaps this is for good reason, Korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developed/developing world. It's really quite amazing. Take a look at these articles ( here and here ) and you'll see what I mean. One reason is many Koreans do not use seatbelts (another article here ). Even I don't, when I'm in the back seat especially of a taxi. It's really quite odd (and scary) that I always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when I'm here...perhaps simply because everyone does it here. People who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road, as described in this article from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. And if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect (more on that here ). So, what's the connection to Greece? Korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in Greece . I'm not sure why, it certainly isn't valid in Canada, you have to do a new test and everything there, but for some reason Greece has opened the doors for Koreans to take to its streets, probably because of the Olympics. ( Apparently Greece is famous for some crazy driving as well .) But then, isn't that a brutal time for Koreans (or any foreigners) to be tooling around town in a rental? Oh well, I'm certainly not going to Greece anytime soon, and if I did I'd probably call George the Super-Cabbie . So, on to Phil. I went there with a bud in December 1998 (most of this file is classified, so this'll be short). One of the highlights was driving from Cebu City (where Ferdinand Magellan was beheaded by King Lapu Lapu way back when) to Moalboal , the noted diving spot. It was about a 3 hours trip on provincial (read: rural, goat/dog/child/rickshaw-strewn) road and on the way back Carlo was at the wheel. For some reason a dog was on the road and Carlo tried to avoid it (really, he did swerve like 3 times, the thing just changed direction again!) but, in the end, it became one with the rubber. Also, a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us (I hope it was a toy, but you never know). With that I started to really question why I'd be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in Phil or any other developing country. Carlo and I returned to Canada safely and got back to work at RBC Dominion Securities where we worked (did I note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase?) but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms. I was in Canada a while longer before coming here and Carlo went to first Turks & Caicos Islands then to Cayman Islands . He left then returned to RBC and, as you can see from the pics below, is an avid flagger, I mean flag football player. Ya, he goes long on the field and goes short in the office. (haha! a little finance/hedge fund humor there for ya!) Watch out Carlo! Looks like that big dude's got your number! Good thing it's flag football. Right now he's Player of the Week! Way to go Carlo! His profile is here and his league's site is here (Carlo, why is the domain dot K-Y??). Oh, and ladies, too late, he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way. Lookin' a little rotund there, Carlo. Well, that's the story, from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog."

It shows me that it's not just Koreans that are into voyeurism (although the Swiss version has one-way glass so people can't see in, and the Korean versions have none such discretion, it seems). Is it me? Or does she look like Martha Stewart? And doesn't that look like a prison cell loo? I was out last night on a 회식 (hwi-shik), which basically means a bender with guys from the office. We went to my favorite local haunt, Outsider. It's called a 'playing bar' in English but in Korean they call it a 양주이밴트바 (yang-joo ee-ben-t-ba, whiskey event bar). Basically, it's not a room salon but it's nicer than a regular hof (or local Korean pub). There are girls pouring the drinks but they are ALWAYS on their side of the bar (which is just fine by me). Of course that wasn't all that we did. We had 삼겹살 (3-layer fat pork, much like backbacon) first and went to WA Bar (when you say the name it sounds like the Korean for 'come here', very apt methinks) afterward. Man, I love living in Yeouido...at least I can get home within 50 steps instead of taking a bus or cab for 20-60 minutes to get home. Sometimes I think I'm a little spoiled here...but then I remember the pollution, long hours and compulsory drinking and I figure it about evens out. Um, where's his other hand!??! So, anyways, this morning I got out of bed at about 4am to do laundry (wild and crazy guy that I am). I was still drunk, obviously, and ended up not checking my shirt pocket for the namecard (that's what they call business cards here) of the new guy (the one on the left in the pic; the middle guy, Yoon, is our new recruit and the guy on the left is Jo-last name-by the way, I think Jo should have the English name of Danny or Daniel, what do you think?). So, it got washed...damn. Well, at least I know what he looks like. Him, Yoon and I are all born in the same year, but I am a few months older, so we can be friends. It's odd here, even a year or so difference and you're considered on a different plane in some respects. Jo is our junior...so we have to take care of him/get him plastered. The nice thing about being a little older is I can pull rank and make everyone drink. hahahaha! But as a 외국인 (way-gook-in, foreigner) I can also claim to be untouchable (in the good sense) if I don't want to do something. hahahaha! (But I usually do it because it's not a good idea to play the race card too much here.) I had to get myself some coffee this morning, but felt cheap (as usual) as there is wonderful Maxim Mocha Gold sticks in the office. I'm sure these things are killing me slowly, but they're just sooo convenient! Also heard that Starbucks just opened their 100th store in Korea (in Itaewon, actually). Yesterday was it's 5th anniversary in Korea...and I remember when I first came here (about 5 years ago, actually) they were just starting. In typical Korean fashion they caught on like wild-fire (foreign, expensive, addictive...what's not to love?) One last thing. Koreans have a special numbering system for counting things, but they can't do the same in English, it seems. They seem to think that 'th' comes after every number. My namecards say that we are on the 2th floor...well, we're not, the 치과 (chi-gwa, dentist) is on the first floor. Then today on T.V. I saw an electronic device that was labeled '2rd cable port'...at least they were trying on that one."
57,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"27,July,2004","Last night I saw Silmido . Man, it reminded me of The Dirty Dozen. The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded). The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated. The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war. Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction. At least The Dirty Dozen achieved their mission...but it was just a story, maybe based on Silmido, who knows?"
58,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"26,July,2004","Yahoo! Finally, after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal. I had almost given up on this place/market, but looks like we've go our foot in the door. Never give up is the motto here. Reminds me of a client of mine I had in Vancouver. I knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area, but it took 2 years to get an account out of him...for $500,000. He said to me three words I'll never forget: persistance beats resistance. Man, what a lesson that was. A friend of mine from Geoje-do (cool blog about teaching experiences on Geoje-do here ) came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the Island. One (Andy) has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 VIP tickets to the MTV Buzz Asia Concert (sponsored by the super-cool iriver company-article here ) at Chamshil Indoor Stadium (which I think is the same as the Jamshil Auxiliary Stadium ). Thanks Andy! I had no idea it would be so packed. We got there just after 7PM, when it started. We read the part on the ticket about first come/first served, but missed the line about 'doors will be open at 4pm'. Whoops (Koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon, knowing them). Well, the place was full, but our VIP friends were already in. The gal (Anne) came out and (owing to her sister who works with the Prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade) she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasn't already full. Thanks Anne! The acts were pretty cool. We missed the first one, 보아/BoA but caught the rest. Take a look at the pics below of BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa . For all the boy bands/acts I tried to get the most masculine pictures I could for my site, but if you want fruitier ones they're all over their sites. (I sometimes wonder about these guys, but at least the girls are hot.) BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa. There were a few J-Pop and Taiwanese acts too: Namie Amuro , Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom . There were a couple of others, but the names were in Chinese and I'm feeling a little lazy now. Namie Amuri, Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom. So, as you know, Koreans love to get together and eat and drink, that's why the after-party was so cool. It was in the uber-tony area of Apkujungdong . It's home of the highest priced real estate (and women) in all of Korea. Yes, I'm sure I saw many genuine Fendi bags and plastic bodies. The best part was the 2 free drink tickets. Ah, there's the Scot in me speaking again. The next day we hung out in lovely Yeouido Park (another review here ) where we fed the birds (below). It reminded me of the flocking to the afterparty/bar/dancefloor the night before...birds of a feather and all that. The gatherings: concert, afterparty, in the park. Here's another flocking ...of Koreans to the beach in Pusan. I think the caption says there are 1,000,000 people there at the beach (about 2/3 of the population of the Vancouver area). I wouldn't put it past them. And my final comment on this topic: credit cards. This article on how Koreans were lured by the notion of 'easy money/credit' (fanned somewhat by the card companies' desire for market share at any cost) and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals (sadly, many of also 'succeeded' in passing on their debts to their heirs, as happens here when a debtor dies)."
59,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"06,August,2004","As promised yesterday , last night I saw a Korean horror movie: 분신사바/Bunshinsaba . First, though, there was time to kill before the movie so a little sam-gyup-sal was in order. We went to Don Don Restaurant in Jong-no (downtown) where there was an interesting concept. It's on the fourth floor and is entirely open-air...but they still had fans and air conditioners on full blast, too. Also, the condiments (쌈장/ssam-jang or bean paste, 상추/sang-choo or lettuce, 미역국/mi-yok-gook or kelp soup and other goodies that are hand-delivered in most restaurants were self-service after the initial place-setting. This was cool for me as (i) I love 쌈장 and 상추 with my pork and (ii) we were seated right next to the buffet. They also cut the pork right in front of you (Koreans are always trying to differentiate themselves, especially regarding food). Trouble is, it kinda reminded me of Lorena Bobbit ...dooough! Next stop was ice cream at LG25 (LG's answer to 7-11...is it really open 25 hours a day?) and try my hand at shooting a Gatling gun. Not a real one, mind you, it shoots pellets. (I'd like to see how my G.I. buddies do at that one.) Of course, the place was staffed by 2 little Korean gals (all the better to lure in the men), one of which was a pretty good shot with the Beretta. Cutting the Pig; Shooting the Gatling; Scaring the Girls They say that fear for Koreans is different from us Westerners ( see article ) but I think it had many similarities to the Western genre...although the setting and plot was a little different. I won't reveal too much, but let's just say that the director did a good job of creating a lot of suspense and fright in that theatre. There was one gal there who went just berserk at about every scary scene (especially in the beginning) and everyone laughed after each outburst. I think she was scared enough for the whole room. Hahaha. Just hilarious. Without that comic relief it would have been a lot scarier, I think. Scenes from the movie...walking...a hand...raising her face (!)...then the final scene...and afterward. Some pics above from the film sorry, figured out my zoom after the first couple, and the lighting, as you might imagine, was not optimal. The effects were minimal compared to I, Robot but very, very effective for this movie. Afterward I took a picture of a lighted billboard. The girl in the white dress wasn't there when I took it...she must be a ghost! Ok, that's a joke, but it sure sounds scary. 푸하하하!"
60,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"05,August,2004","I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place. The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong! And push-ups! More pics on the site (it's all in Korean, but no translation needed for the images. Now, I knew that Korean women are strong in spirit, but had not seen many like this. Most Korean men like their gals to be smaller, weaker (well, most guys do, it's just more prevalent here) so it takes real...um....balls for a gal to go into this sport. I don't mind it, myself. Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey."
61,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"04,August,2004","Seoul is a pretty good place for outdoor activities, as long as you live in the right part of town (which I do, thank you!). There are a few parks around but 2 of the largest are Olympic Park (a massive place that I lived near for 6 months when I stayed with my in-laws when I first came here...they were right in the '88 Olympic Village, which was nice) and Yeouido Park (which was like a parking lot before they revamped it and added trees and stuff). View of Yeouido Core; the park at 6AM one Spring morning...gorgeous; The Great King Sejong; and, to top it off, a guy sleeping in a gazebo. Take a look at the scene above...this is like a block from my home and work. Before the office moved to this side of the park these views were my commute everyday...a 12 minute walk from door-to-door. Pretty cool, eh? Sure it costs a bit more to live in Yeouido and there isn't a Lotte Mart (Korean Wal-Mart) to be found in the immediate area, but it's real nice here, I think. The Great King Sejong is credited with 'inventing', or at least causing the invention of, Hanguel (the Korean alphabet, although it's not really an alphabet, it's more a set of sounds put to writing...very scientific for back then). His name and image is all over the place, especially at schools. There is also a book store and securities company named after him. And what stroll in Seoul would be complete without seeing a guy sleeping on the ground or floor (as reported before a few times). This guy looks prepared, though. He had the presence of mind to bring a mummy sleeping bag and get himself in the gazebo (and away from the early-morning dew that is so prominent here in the Spring). For exercise, the little that I do here, I like to inline skate (as they call rollerblading here). Take a look at these shots: LG Twins Building, 63 Building, and Traffic! Here's the lovely LG Twins Building (owned by LG Group, formerly Lucky Goldstar, also owner of the LG Twins baseball team; there are rumored to be anti-aircraft guns on the top of these towers to help defend Seoul); the 63-story tall &#"

Anyways, there are a couple things that may help get my buds over to Seoul sometime soon (you know who you are). Many have threatened to come here, and some read my blog and may be on the verge, but this should about do it. Here it is: Seoul, home of the sexiest women on the planet . (Not that they have a chance at meeting them, but they are in the city limits, apparently.) There's also the interesting theme parties they have at Bricx Bar in Itaewon. I've still never been to one, but the last one ( the Bikini Party ) almost got me there. The next one is a Jungle theme. Unga-bunga! Ok, she's not Korean...she may not even be in Seoul...but it's a mighty fine pic. Of course if you do hook up with a Korean (especially a Korean gal) you may find yourself a victim of 'the Coupling'. I've heard it's only with married couples, but I suspect that boyfriends get roped into this look as well. Watch out. Beware 'the Coupling'."

Think I remember seeing them in Vancouver too, but this ones is not just feet but arms. There are lasers or something that sense where and how he moves his arms and if it's in sync with the instructions/music. The guy was pretty thin and the moves made him look quite gay. I wonder if he does these kinds of actions on the dancefloor...I wouldn't if I were him, the gals in the arcade/gameroom were really laughing it up (good thing the music was really loud). If this guy's got all the moves why are the girls laughing so hard??"
65,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"02,August,2004","There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed 5-day work-week coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as this story attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a past blog , get ready for some comedy and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics. Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work. Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting. Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was (형님들의 도시)목포는항구다 (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint). Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot King Arthur was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out. I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about the actor, Ray Winstone, I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life? Alex Bors and Mark...which is which? I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for that one). Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time."

I was just taking a look through my millions of jpegs and such and found these two to be, well, eerily similar. DPRK's Kim Jong-il and U2's Bono Is it me? Or does North Korea 's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea/DPRK) 'Dear Leader' look at least a bit like U2 's Bono? Of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but I get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long, the throngs of adoring fans (well, in Kim's case adoring may be a stretch) and accompanying entourage/roadies may have made them both a little distant from work-a-day realities. At least Bono doesn't require visitors to put flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father , though.

Take a look at this article about changing the age of majority from 20 (already a year younger than the U.S.) to 19 (the same as British Columbia, Canada, but higher than the 18 that is prevalen federally and in some Canadian provinces). Here parents are commenting on the ability to take on rights and responsibilities at the tender age of 19. 'My boy is almost an adult now and the law now even considers him a man, but he has to learn his responsibilities and accept his own choices in life,' Han Ho-sun, mother of a 20-year-old, said. 'But what does he know? He is not ready to make decisions as an adult yet. And if he is granted too much freedom, I'm worried he'll get himself into trouble.' Other parents of young adults agreed. They nodded their heads to the idea that the government, before lowering the adult age, should provide training and programs to teach what adult responsibilities entail - such as building up a good credit record, making political decisions and getting married. ' What? 19 years? Kids that age aren't really mature enough to handle anything! Let alone complete adulthood,' said one parent who asked for anonymity. The first two seem pretty sensible, but the last one (if the name wasn't withheld) would be prime fodder for the Tonight Show's Headlines segment, I think. Then there's this article about the capture of an ex-convict suspected of stabbing to death two police offices a few days ago. This part deserves special attention: As police raided the house, Lee injured himself by stabbing his abdomen and thighs several times while holding a child and a 48-year-old woman as hostages to resist arrest. He was immediately sent to Ehwa Womans University Mok-dong Hospital for emergency treatment... What? Did I just read that right? The suspect stabbed himself enough to need to go to the emergency room? What was he trying to do? Commit suicide so as to evade capture?!??! Methink perhaps the (can I say vengeful?) police on the scene may have helped him guide the knife just a bit . Maybe he did stab himself, but it sure seems weird. Here's an op/ed on the capture and how it was handled by the police."

For Koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies. 1st because the child made it through the often-treacherous first year (remember, Korea used to be really, really poor...so much so that is was a 100-days celebration as well, but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it). 60th because the Korean Zodiac is similar to the Chinese one...with 12 animals (ya, I'm a pig). There are also five colors which elude me at the moment, although I know two of them are black and gold. The Chinese use five elements: metal, earth, wood, fire and water. This year is Year of the Wood Monkey , which I guess is better than 1981... Year of the Wood Cock/Rooster . (Hehe, had to put that in there.) Anyways, at age 60 you've gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colors/elements...a truly magical time, I guess. Thus, by age 60 men (no mention of women) should have at least one grandchild, preferably a grandSON one more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wife's father's 60th year! Now about foreingers (as I/we call all non-Koreans...even in Canada for some reason). Korea ain't called The Hermit Kingdom for nothin'. Basically, there are very, very few foreigners here. Something like 200,000 in a country of 48 Million. Most of us are (like me) in Seoul and (not like me) teachers. Others are manual labour workers from China, India and Southeast Asia (doing the 3D-dirty, dangerous, difficult-jobs that Koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass). Foreigners (or 외국인/weigook-in or 외국사람/weigook-saram) are treated quite differently from native Koreans (and likely for good reason in some cases). We all need to register with our local 구/ku (ward/borough) office and do so (i) every 12 months or (ii) if we move to another 구 (whichever comes first). We get an Alien Registration Card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type (teachers are E-2, I fall under E-7 or 'other worker, director'). We need the ARC to get a job, get a bank account or do almost everything else official here. But it's not the same as a Korean Citizenship Card. Some promotions, for example the bonus card for Fantaseum , is only for Koreans, not me. So I can't get 10% off movies or get bonus points there...waaaaaaaaa! Also, foreigners cannot easily buy land in Korea (although I've also heard that it just can't be done...not sure who to believe on this). Foreign investment companies, however, still did so and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis. (In fact, they were the first firms in Korea to EVER use due diligence/research before buying and developing land...Korean execs, it seems, did it based more on intuition than anything else before then.) It's also hard for foreign firms to get market share here unless they partner with a local firm such as Otis did with LG Group concerning elevators and escalators. Heck, foreign car makers have just 3% of the local market ! (Not counting GM's recent purchase of Daewoo Motors, which is a small player anyways.) One thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled Korean companies. Korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible, but in the end they can take on foreign investors 대한생명/DaeHan sengmyung/Life aka Korea Life Insurance is 5% owned by Australia's largest bank, Macquarie Bank . Korean firms, however are loathe, it seems, to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses. 교보생명/Kyobo Sengmyung/Life apparently had months of due diligence done on it by buyout firms , but in the end not enough was known to do a deal. Foreign firms have been able to buy billions of USD in Korean stocks , SK Life , large portions of Korean banks , other firms and one ( PCA ) is in the running to buy 대한투자증권/DaeHan Tooja Jeunkwon/DaeHan ITC/Investment Trust Company aka Daetoo (names here can get pretty long and complicated) though, so there is some opening up of this place. Funny, the longer I'm here, the more normal all of this seems...not sure that is a good thing."

He came at the perfect time. Weather was getting warm, but not unbearably hot and Children's Day and Buddha's Birthday were celebrated (day off) during his time here too. That was cool. Here are some pics from his visit. We did almost everything you could as a tourist for a short visit (but light on the bar scene as I was not as educated as I am now on it...and he was so young and impressionable at the time). Welcome to Korea...you must have SARS; Seoul City Hall traffic square; Myoungdong on the weekend; kids and wooden swords @ Korean Heritage Museum; us at the Korean Folk Village ; on the bus heading to Incheon Airport . He had a fever (from a normal cold) a few days before he got here, so that and the general lack on English language ability by almost everyone here lead him to be delayed getting out of the airport by over an hour. Next time I'll give my visitors a little note in Korean to show the airport staff saying: 'I'm a top gamer from _______ please make sure I don't miss my tournament and speed me through customs quickly.' or some such thing Koreans love their online games here; they even have a TV station dedicated to it. Lars had this to report about Korea (and he's flown about 1,000,000 miles thus far): it's similar to Europe, but just LOTS more people. The second person was a guy I met through a teacher in Pusan/Busan I know through a friend of mine in Nanaimo (my old roommate, actually; funny how things seem to dovetail as we get on in years). Anyways, her sister's bud is getting married to a gal in Taegu/Daegu and wanted some pointers on how to not screw-up in front of the in-laws-to-be. He was here for a week or so and in Seoul for a couple of days...but I think we crammed a week of drinking into one night . Yusheng should have a good time here and should be here sometime in the fall, date to be determined. The guy's some kinda world traveler and he takes some pretty cool pic of architecture wherever he goes. I've noticed that many of them are devoid of human presence...something he'd be challenged to do in Seoul. There's always people around you here no matter the time or place. If you want to see some cool shots of my other hometown, Vancouver, take a look here . Ok, time to get my pubmaps out and plan Yusheng's course."
72,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,August,2004","I think if I'm going to claim 여의도/Yeouido as my new hometown I should know something about it...and by extension you should too. I've got a little more to add to my background on it thus far . As you may know, ~do can mean two things in Korean. One is: province, such as 경기도/Kyunggi-do. The other is island, such as 제주도/Jeju-do (also spelled Cheju-do, depending on what era the map or publication was edited in...things changed in 2002, just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the World Cup). Since Yeouido (also spelled Youido, Yoido and Yeoido) is pretty tiny and part of 영등포구/Youngdeungpo-ku (ku is like a ward or borough such as Queen's or The Bronx) the ~do here signifies that it's an island. I had no idea that its ~do was 'island' because it looks as though they've filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated Yeouido from the mainland. Anyways, way back when Yeouido used to be on the outskirts of Seoul and it housed the countries first real airport. (Later Gimpo/Kimpo Airport was built in the new outskirts of Seoul and now, since the city is not getting any smaller, Incheon Airport is the new International airport for Seoul; although Kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic.) In fact, Yeouido Park , which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is, was the runway of that airport! So, here in West Yeouido, near the park, is where the streets are named 양말산/Yang-mal-san or 'sock mountain'. I got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain...there wasn't a sock factory here to my knowledge and I hadn't heard a story about removing one's socks for any reason (although I wouldn't dismiss it if I heard it; there are so many different traditions here). When I heard about the airport I came up with this theory: sock mountain is the hill (here they call a mountain what we in Vancouver would call a knoll, I find) where the windsock was placed. Make sense? For more exciting and ground-breaking news stay tuned to this blog."
73,3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,August,2004","Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950. Let's just say that it's not near as lovingly embraced as in the West/US. Gays marrying in Korea? C'mon! There are no Korean gays! Of course, if one is gay one can hardly be Korean. I'm not trying to piss of PCers out there, this is just the way many Koreans (especially men and older ones) think. Although the younger generation are more open to other ideas, it's the older generation that controls politics, education, finance, and even media and culture to a large degree. The CEOs of the TV stations are all men and all old guys, as an example. Things are changing, though, as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in Itaewon. (Now that you know its name you can either (i) know where to go or (ii) know where to avoid depending on your preference.) Yikes! Here are a few websites on gays in Korea: here and here . This blog has a tongue-in-cheek explanation of what being gay is...basically a primer in ' gaydar ' (how to recognize a gay in Korea or elsewhere). However, I think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics. It's pretty weird sometimes. In a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg (just above the knee) as he spoke of my experience in finance and what I do for the investment process. This would be outrightly gay, but in Korea it's ok...it just shows (non-sexual) fondness and a measure of trust between two people. My boss does it also...much to the surprise of foreigners in our group...but, again, it's not 'gay' its just the culture here. My wife's uncle holds my hand, too...and not for 2-3 seconds; for 2-3 minutes. At first I thought it was pretty weird, but it just means that he really likes me. (Having said all this I know I'll have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when I see my buds back in Canada, crap.) Over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls, but it's just not sexual. Many young gals (especially) can be seen holding hands while walking down the road. Add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most Western guys. You get used to it, though. I really wonder about some of these Korean guys, though. The Face Shop has a model on all of their (make-up) stores that's pretty gay looking. There are others as well. These guys are (I hope) more metrosexual than homosexual, although the distinction is greying. Many of the boy bands have similar dudes in them-the clothes, the hair, the dance moves. I got to really wonder sometimes. (Remember this guy? ) Perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in Korea most gays don't come out of the closet choosing instead to marry, have kids and be a 'normal' person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that they're too busy with their career to find a wife. Either way, it's quite different from in the West where there is more acceptance of such things. On another topic: yesterday I had lunch with my CEO/boss and he mentioned that China and Korea were having a tiff about the Gorguyeo Dynasty . He said, 'oh, how can you know about that...it is just Korean history'. Well, when I said that is was about 50AD-600AD and was concurrent with the Paekche and Shilla empires and before the United Shilla dynasty that preceded the closely-named Koryo Dynasty of about 1100-1300AD that was right before the venerated Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910 he just looked at me. Not sure if he got all of what I said, but a colleague dining with us said that I do, in fact, know about Korean history...hey, I've been here almost 2 years-and not all of it has been in the bars. My dates of Koryo are a little off, but if you want more information of where Korea came from take a look at this site . It has a cool timeline...just right if you're writing a report! So, if you're speaking with a Korean don't be surprised if they assume that since you're a foreigner you can't know precisely anything about Korea and if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here. Oh, and just for the record: I'm not gay."

Unsure of what to do next, I run my fingers through your hair. Then we hug. This position once so odd now becomes the most comforting thing in my entire world. Then the bell rings. Yes... the bell. Once it was my savior and now I am betrayed by the bell. We stand hand in hand as the world goes on around us. I tell you I love you. You say it back. I weekly say good-bye. I walk away, only twenty steps away. I look back to see you watching me... A fading memory. I run back and kiss you. A perpetual kiss. When we part and walk away, the warmth remains on our lips. You take with you a huge part of my life. Not only do you have my entire heart, you have my first kiss too. Remember me fondly forever, because I will never forget you. I love you. Good-bye."

Am I supposed to remember everything? I have no clear images of these last moments with my dearest friends. Just foggy memories continuously fading. We have virtually three days left of school and NOW the teachers are piling stuff on us. Finals one after another. Last minute projects are popping out of nowhere!

I don't want to say good bye. We can say we'll be friends forever, but the truth is, no matter how much you hate to admitt it, people grow appart. High School is the hardest most crusal part of anyone's life, and I'm left to face it without my sheild, my crutches, my wings. I'm alone. Clanless. Friendless. As every body stands up in High School, still hand in hand walking together, helping eachother; I wander, holding my own hand, being crushed and stepped on by the clans of friends. That's me. Flattend to the ground. The loner. No friends, no passion, no will to live. I'm starting over. Never have I stayed in one school for more than two years... never. So every other year I am forced to start over. This is like the others, but different. This is more important to me than anything else. I can't start over again.

Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this “Quick Write” the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didn’t have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance. My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. He’d be easy to talk to. He’d always listen and He’d be great at giving advice. I wouldn’t be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; I’d know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; He’d simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. He’d be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; He’d treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. He’d be my best friend. It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldn’t explain why. Then she pointed out that every time the nameless friend was mentioned, I had capitalized the pronoun. That’s pretty uncommon in the English language, unless of course you are referring to God or Jesus. Read the “Quick Write” again. Doesn’t it seem to describe God/Jesus?"

Do you think it’s fair that the most PERFECT man, who never sinned in his entire life, was tortured and killed for OUR sins and wrongdoings?

92,3539003,female,14,indUnk,Aries,"11,August,2004","I love to dance. I love the natural high I get from dancing. My movement is so limitless. Every emotion can be told through dance. I can’t even begin to explain the rush I get from dancing. I get so lightheaded. I don’t care what other people think. I don’t care what I look like, or what I’m doing. I become so incredibly care free. I am never free from stress anymore. I’m constantly working, and am always stressed out. I can never get a break! But when I’m dancing, I stop thinking. Everything lifts from my shoulders. I can move freely. There is absolutely nothing on my mind when I’m dancing, and I get light headed and dizzy. When I need to escape, I turn on the radio and wait for a good song to come on. Then I dance until I can hardly move anymore. Everything is forced from me. No more anger, anxiety, depression, stress, ECT. I am completely tranquil. Dance."
93,3539003,female,14,indUnk,Aries,"11,August,2004","People are always saying, “Just be yourself”. When you say, “I don’t know how to act in this situation”, they always say, “Just be yourself”. But what if “yourself”, I mean the way you truly are when no one is watching, it not what they wanted or expected. You are constantly rejected for “yourself”. How would anybody attain friends or a significant other? Certainly not by being you. So according to the surrounding people, be it at home, at church, with your friends, you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person. Like a chameleon, you change your colors, attitudes, style, personality, completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings. So when people say, “Just be yourself,” think about it. They are really saying “Look, act, be… how I want you to be.”"
94,3539003,female,14,indUnk,Aries,"11,August,2004","Have you ever had the feeling you were alone? Even though the whole world is surrounding you, they aren’t really with you at all. I was sitting next to my best friend and her boyfriend who at that time was my crush. I look down at their hands, holding each other’s hands. I look down at my hands holding nobody’s but my own. As I was walking to my next class, with my arms crossed, I saw them again. This time they were hugging. Again I look at myself to see that I was in fact hugging nobody but myself. I really shouldn’t feel so alone, but for some unknown reason I do. It is painful, being alone and all. But I know there’s someone out there for me too. Actually, I KNEW there was someone out there for me, until I met my love. I finally found him. There is nobody that could compare to him. Until fate breaks us apart, which we both know will happen soon, I’m NOT alone. For once, I’m not alone."

96,4172416,female,25,indUnk,Capricorn,"08,August,2004","Election time has rolled around again. And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state 'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move. Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more: 'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism. Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string. Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight. 'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal! I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed."

'A few months later, on his next visit, he took Isabelle for a walk in the garden and told her that he was being posted abroad and that he was not in a position to continue their friendship. he skated round the question of marriage with pleas of poverty and unworthiness. isabelle didn't care whether he married her or not, but when he said he would not see her again she felt the simple agony of bereavement, like a child whose only source of love has gone. for three years her loss coloured every moment of her day. when at last it became bearable it was still like a wound on which the skin would not thicken, so the least thing could reopen it. the reckless innocence of her unguided childhood was finished, but eventually a sweetness and balance in her nature returned.' this section stands out to me. the book has yet to mention war actually lol but a very steamy (and by the woman's description - very satisfying) scene! 'she was choking with passion for him, but he frightened her. she wanted to comfort him but also to be taken by him, to be used by him.' hmm i like this book lol newas gota go watch the match! sarah xxx"

Foriegn leaves skittered after her, pushing her further away from their familiar habitat, chasing her to the border of her own world. Falling - to her inexorable melancholy bare-existance. She'd like to see the arrow splintered in his pulse, she'd like to see his eyes flood with lies. Drawing in. Sucking; bleeding; watching you gasping. A little smile plays upon her lips, her eyes excitedly wide - they narrow again, as her fingers step to a lament only she can hear, echoing throughout her hollow mind. Numb. Entrapt in this bitter wind. Kneeling down in the dirt, one long nail traces a symbol. Lifting a blue teardrop from beneath small lashes - it's blessed. Rising, dizzy with energy, she falters, regains control, she holds the chains now. She binds and sways the wind to her desire, encircling her 'til she cannot breathe.

See ah..to confess sin. Step 1: Commit a sin. Without a sin, how can you ever confess?? Step 2: Do some reflection about the sin. Step 3: Confess and you shall be forgiven. Common sense answer right? No sin, how to confess? So must commit a sin in order to confess. haha..nonsense la. I was very satisfied with my meals today. Didn't eat breakfast.

132,4198080,female,23,indUnk,Aquarius,"10,August,2004","Well, I hate to start off no such a sour note, but things haven't been going so great with me lately and here's the dirty. Well, my job (I work as a Quality Assurance Tester) isn't that great, and they've been laying people off left and right at my job. I just found out today that this one guy got the axe a few weeks ago, but was told that his last day will be sometime in OCTOBER!!! Can you imagine being told that you aren't an asset to the corporation but that they want to hold on to you for two more months? I couldn't imagine it myself. Aside from that everything with my boyfriend and I aren't going that well. He just seems to never really hear me. He's always so defensive and he never wants to be wrong. He can say somethng that he doesn't like about me, but then when I say the littlest negative thing about him he's all defensive and saying 'oh why do you switch it and make me look like i'm the bad person?' Come on give me a break. I've seen him 5 times in the last three weeks, but he see's nothing wrong with that. I mean people that live in different states see there loved one more then I see mines. And then to add fuel to the fire I found out that I'm the victim of credit card fraud. I can't believe the asshole only left me with $20 on my credit card! Thank God I have others, and thank God I don't have to pay for what I didn't use. Then my girlfriend, whom I've known since High School, is having a baby so me, and two of her childhood friends along with her brother are throwing her a shower. Well, at least we thought that we were. My girlfriend sent us information about what she would like for her party, but one of the girls is taking matters into her own hands. She replied to my friends message telling her that she need to mention anything because WE have it covered. Then she sends out the so called 'Party Committee' an email, and here are some excerpt from it: 1.) Theme: 'Red. her favorite color and because it's a boy she and I decided the shower has a red theme. She just told me in an email red and white and now she is looking for yellow but since i am in charge of decorations, I fell confident we can stick to our original color theme. Id we have to use an additional color that's cool, no one shohuld break their necks but white on red NOT red on white, which is totally diffferent. ' I mean seriousl, I don't thin that the whole 'Red Theme' is suitable for a baby shower. I agree more with the yellow. There will be kids there as well, so I just think that it should be somethng that would appeal both to adult and children. It is a baby shower for crying out loud. 2.) 'We will have red theme drinks and decoration. no cartoon prints like Blues Clues, Disney, etc. for example, She likes this giraffe that is yellow with red spots (he id not famous, she just seen it somewhere). This baby shower has more of a sophisticated dinner party feel as opposesd to a traditional baby shower feel. We will have red roses as the center pieces instead of one of those baby shower things. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A SOPHISTICATED DINNER PARTY, we have to serve the people appetizers on trays. Am i playing servent for the night or what? Can i sit and enjoy the day with my friend? I don't understand why you want a dinner party instead of a baby shower and on top of that there's not DJ! We (the Party Commiteess that is) has to make a mix CD each! I mean why have a party committee if one person is making all the decisions? Well, on a better note, i'm sooo excited about this coming weekend. My girlfriends and I are going to Six flags. I haven't been out there since I was about 12, which has been to long."

(bugger) still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new: what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before? i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire. staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12 n."

(these will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've started it as simple as possible) imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run. this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at every other stop and thus completing the run faster. however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with an amount of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid. so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause those stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog. so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row. assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour, or will have a ticket for a certain bus company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately. whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus: yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no: no distance/order change between buses if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging. and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely. anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me. n."

(hairdressers, not the marines...) and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr. is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again. i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much. when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect. i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh. even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through. i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it. i hate the hairdressers. i really do."

165,3705830,male,25,Non-Profit,Cancer,"16,August,2004","i have cracked spider solitaire. last week i came up with a method of defeating it, and i haven't lost a game since. some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky, but i've completed every single one. now, everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one, but today i tried a game on the hard setting. i completed it. convinced? i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire, every frame can be beaten . an obvious statement, perhaps, but important, i think. i developed the idea on the two-suit variety, and i haven't done it rigorously, but i hope you'll get the idea. general principles, then. i) always keep a spare cell when you can. this is the most useful space since anything can be put there. always work to be making a new spare cell; the more the better. ii) keep a track on colour (or suit) changes; the less, the better. always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can. before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board. iii) clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card; runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards. iv) if you have many of one card value, then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving non-running cards on top of them. v) using two free spaces, simple runs of different suits can be moved using the tower of hanoi principle. vi) completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched 'useful' and 'unuseful' cards. vii) stacking up suit-changing runs isn't a bad thing; it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end. it is common (on the medium setting) to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea. but, most importantly, and the key to the whole issue, is that you have to remove the element of chance from the game. if you rely on luck, there is a good chance you will be beaten. if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game. (it is up to you whether you consider this worthwhile, or 'in the spirit of the game'; i started doing it to investigate whether each frame is possible. it is possible that each frame is possible in a number of ways, but i'm not sure how to show this). i call this 'the riley method'; and basically it means being ruthless, and never giving up. the key to this is the 'undo' function. if something doesn't look like its working out, go back. try something else. you can undo back to the last suit-removal or new row, and often you'll need to try a few different approaches. mostly, the objective is to complete another suit, but beware that this can scupper you if you've filled all the spare cells, so be careful. overall, then, i can't say this will guarantee you success. i've been playing cards since i was little and i've built up a good understanding of cardplay, and i have a fairly mathematical brain to start with. but i thought i'd mention it; if only to explain what i've been doing with my time. i'd be interested to hear any comments anyone has; and again i haven't looked to see if anyone has written about this before, i prefer working the puzzle myself. list of puzzles i that i looked up the answer for: the morris sequence (my favourite sequence puzzle ever) rubik's clock (well, lee dicks told me because he's an arrogant bastard but i'd showed no signs of getting the answer myself) there are probably others. n."

An underhanded and mean reality show that takes AWFUL singers who think they are good and lets them howl on international TV. The cast members they chose were perfect Tone-Loc, Vitamin C and a guy named Briggs. Their acting ability to sit there and pretend to be loving people singing like cats in a blender in indeed impressive. So they take them to Hollywood give them makeovers and let them sing..badly. The final 4 were well chosen Jo-Jo who told people it was his 'gah-dunk-a-dunk' that made him star material.

Jaime the obligatory blonde bimbo with more cup size than cranium size. Rosa the latina firecracker who lives in her own lil world and was probably the worst singer there.

Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile. Cheers"

'When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.' He thought for a moment. 'Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?' he asked, looking at her across the table. 'A great many, I fear,' she cried. 'Then commit them over again,' he said gravely. 'To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.' 'A delightful theory!' she exclaimed. 'I must put it into practice.' 'A dangerous theory!' came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 'Yes,' he continued, 'that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.' A laugh ran round the table.~~ The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a 'certain age' they have to act a 'certain way'... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age... I can think of lots of 'follies' from my youth I would love to repeat... and do so on every available occasion....lol"

The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God!

They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun. Picture two octopi rubberbanded together, and poke. Neato. Last night the kids and I went to a local eating establishment and met Tim's new coworker, Gina. Sweet girl, funny, outgoing, cute for a borderline midget. I, however, hope that we can use young Gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name. Run and hide, Tora Teenus , for you shall have no peace once you are found."

He muttered a silent blessing to Khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land. He and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog, if he does not bring this message to Aldamir, the rest of the army would be in peril. Adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead. Lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees, which provide ample cover for them. There was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals. The chitterling horde marched forward, ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together. “I hate this damn whether!” Quikchitter bared his teeth. Quikwarp who stood proudly. beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back. He was honored to be invited by the Grey seer to ride upon the Cauldron of thousand poxes. As the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter, which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon. Quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination, the arrogant Quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army. “ Quikwarp I have an important task for you.” “What is your wish? Most potent of potentates,” He replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly. “I need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well, recently there seems to be some minor malfunction,” Quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes. Only to be responded by hideous hissing sound. His ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news. He muttered silent cures to the Grey seer and half hopingly that he hadn’t heard it. He made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose, he wondered how could the Grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell. It was all too possible; the selfish Grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone. As he walked towards his own company of clan Skyre rats, he thought he had smelled something. Among the smell of furs and rats, he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder. “Elves!” He curse the day that he had been born, the foul rats have spotted them. If they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats. There would be no chances of survival. If they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message. But sacrifices were needed to be made. He signaled one of men and whispered into his ears. His face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task. The Grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him. He attempts a grasp at the winds of magic. Gathering a small globe of energy in his hands, he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron. The rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting. Poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin. And soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells. “Faster, faster, quick, quick!” The Grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip. Suddenly, bells were rung and he knew they were being attack. Anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army. The frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy. Shouting war cries and froth and phlegm’s dripped from their mouth. Quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision, and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks. The vision shifted in and out, blurring images and palpable ones. The spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army. “Stupid fools, its only a horse,” he spoke softly under his breath. A green light glowed madly on his fingers, sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground. He incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse. Reducing it into a pile of dust. The blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army. A boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory. “ Well done men.” Lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear."
219,3429420,male,15,Student,Aquarius,"23,May,2004","The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past, at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe. The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow. The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades weren’t doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground. “To me!” Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. “ Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!” The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.” Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs weren’t as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. “ On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!” He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding. Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. “Now!” the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. “ Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!” Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered. Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. “Fle’ be fo ma, da wil‘ na de fet ma.” His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice. Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, “Thou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.” Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, “ I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.” “The battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,” he spoke softly. Mansuetus nodded and said, “Yes, my lord.” Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. “Mansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.” Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, “I missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.” He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. “I have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.” He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river. He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river. He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. “Mliara!” shouted the battle-trained warrior. “I can..not…..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you must…carry on!” she slurred as tears burst forth from her. “My love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.” He ran back and carries her on the back. “You cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.” Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. “I’m sorry my loved one,” she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground. Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically. A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. “We spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.” The leader’s words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. “ Please wake up my love, I beg of you.”"

We all are prisoners at one time or another in our lives, prisoners to ourselves or to the expectations of those around us. It is a burden that all people endure, that all people despise, and that few people ever learn to escape. I perhaps are one of them who cannot escape the bound of reality.

I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering. The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds. Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time. Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha The devil There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell! The dark Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning. Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it. The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine."

I gave up on my Rolling Thunder(tm) style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen. I want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff, but that's probably because I've had Zelda on the brain recently. I wonder if the Zelda games are named specifically after Zelda Fitzgerald...I guess I'll never know. I like top down shooters, maybe I'll make another one of those. Earth Defender B was kinda lame, though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects. For the people reading what kind of 2D game would you like to see, maybe a puzzle game? I don't know."

The final wasn't that hard except for one problem that I didn't do because I didn't even know where to start. The only class I'm worried about is Linear Algebra, or as it should be called 'Hard ass shit that I'll never remember and barely understand in the first place'. Man, I thought Calc 2 was tough. I'll take problems dealing with the surface area of graphs rotated into 3-space any day over these problems. I really hope I get a C or B in this class. If I did worse on the final than I though then I could get a D. If that happens then this semester is a total waste. I need so many more math classes than anything else that to not pass one puts off my graduation by one more semester. The fact that I can't take any math classes this summer semester is, for me, a total travisty. Add to that the fact that I can't take ANY classes this summer and I'm pretty bummed about that. I was hoping to at least be able to take another yoga class or a programming class, or an art class. But no, nothing fits my work schedual. I feel like I should want to party because I'm done with school for a little while but I really don't. As much as I can't stand individual people I like to be around people in general and school is a great way to do this. Now I'll have nothing to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I guess I could look for another job for the summer, but that would be lame too. OHH SHIT!! I got it, I can try being a dealer at a casino,I've always wanted to do that. Man that would be so sweet, I would be standing there and be all like 'Sir would you like to hit or stand...' and he would say 'Hit me' and I would give him another card and then I would probably say 'Ohh Sorry sir, I guess you shouldn't have hit' and then I'll take his money. The only problem is that the only casino within driving distance (for me) is Casino San Pablo and playing blackjack there is like playnig golf underwater, it doesn't work the way it's supposed to and it just isn't fun. Well, now I don't have anything to do for several hours. Ohh well, maybe I should just be depressed about it or something..."

Surely I'm not the only one that sees not only one, but the prospect of TWO new Zelda games as momentous news. Hmm...there is indeed something wrong with this world. I was much later for work than normal today, my alarm clock may be broke or something. It better wake my ass on time for my comparitive politics final tomorrow. I brought home a broken Palm m515 (or some similar model number) from work today with high hopes to take it apart and finally get a part I need to fix my Palm Zire 71. After 30 minutes of using various tools to break apart the Palm I finally extracted the tiny ribbon cable that I needed only to find that the connector on one end is different. What a bunch of damn communazi jerks. I was so let down. I wasn't even mad (at first). Oh well, it's not like I'll die without a PDA."

I have a vague notion that at one point in history mongol hordes swept across the land killing a bunch of people and stuff, but after they got beat back did they just become hermits? When was the last time you rememberanything happeneing there, or them doing anything at all in the world? Never. After Mongolia I started thinking about Portugal. You never hear anything about Portugal either. I can understand Mongolia, it's way the hell out of the way near Siberia. It may even be part of Russia or China these days. But Portugal, man they're right there on the edge of Europe. I never hear anything, and I mean anything about portugal. I remember talking about WWII in school. We leraned that Spain was neutral during the war, we knew about how pretty much every European country stood, every one aside from Portugal. What happened to them, did they just vanish after the age of exploration....has anyone bothered to check!!! Since I'm obviously on the internet right now I know that I could just read about these places, but that would be too easy. I think it's time that T.V. started informing us about countries that it doesn't really talk about already. We need to hear about Mongolia, Portugal, Estonia, and others I don't know that name of because I never hear about them. STOP THE GEOGRAPHICAL ELITISM."

After the big pile of dog poo that was the Ledgend of the Windwaker I'm so glad that they decided to make the Zelda game that people want, not try to reinvent the series as a cartoon that you play. At first, when looking at the screenshots, I was a little confused. I thought 'Hey, these are screenshots of 'A link to the past''. Then I realized that there wern't four Links in that game. However this game does indeed use many of the same graphics that were used in 'Link to the Past'. Hopefully it will also include the dark world and stuff, though this game looks prettty triforce free. Well, I guess you can't have everything, even though I really really would like to have the Triforce of wisdom....hint hint... Oh yeah, stuff has happened in my life since yesterday, but it hardly seems worth talking about considering this Zelda news. UPDATE: I have learned that there is another Zelda game in the works . This one is 3D and looks like it will give little kinds and grown-ups alike nightmares that will put them off sleep for days. Just check out the screenshots, the one with Link fighting the GIANT ASS DEMON looked scarey as hell. I saw that guy and figured it had to be all over for Link, I really don't see how the little guy can pull off a victory aginst what looks like a 5 story building of a demon. Ohh man, I can't wait for this shit.....I wish I could freeze myself in carbonite or something untill this shit comes out."

Before I forget I'd like to give a big shoutout to Isabella Wunder for linking to me, though she could have used slightly better link text than 'Boring Ass' but I guess you have to take it how it comes. I'd also like to give a big shout out to Miss Macy and Ember I guess the Benicia crew is in da house or off the hook something. Reguarding my dreams, it seems that my sunconscious picked up on my distaste for my recent dreams and game me a little treat last night. I had a dream I was playing a dope ass team based FPS similar to Tribes but with really good graphics and you could control players with your mind. However it wasn't all good, I had to put the game system together before I could play the game and even then my step dad was watching the whole time grunting about wanting to watch tv.

Being stuck trying to turn right at a country road stopsign, trying to play pool but not being able to find a pool que, arguing with someone about the use of mercenaries in the war in Iraq. While I'm sure that all this is just dripping with deep meaning and insight both into my own mind and into the true nature of human society I just with that the way this insight were conveyed was a little more interesting or exciting. Why can't I have dreams where I'm superman or something and I just fly around and save people....that would be so rad. Anyways, my subconscious mind aparently wants me to know that hiring mercenaries in Iraq is cheaper than sending our own troops because we don't have to pay for six months of training, during which time we have no extra troops. I hadn't thought about this point before having it told to me in a dream, odd that a part of me is spending time thinging about arguemnts to support things I'm against. What a jerk."

And since fiction is more interesting than describing the fact that I took some test yesterday or that I talked to someone the I hadn't seen in a while I guess I can write some here and have almost no one read it anyway. I removed the story I was writing, it was leaving the realm of bloggable short story and entering the realm of longish tale. Plus it was boring and uninspired. I still like the idea of the story with only really reflects the experiances I've had in office work. It's funny how you got to places and everything seems to run smoothly, but then you get a job there and you realize that it's like one big balancing act and it's amazing that everything doesn't come crashing down all the time. My favorite was when I work in customer service. Man, I didn't know crap about the products people were asking me about, no one did. Ohh well."

260,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"25,June,2004","It's strange to think that every person is like a walking universe. Every person sees things through their own perspective and with their own thoughts coloring what they see. You would think that with all this uniqueness of thought and perspective going around there would be many different personalities and a real sense of individualism to go with it, but there's not. For as far as people have gone group affiliation still seems to be a driving force in society. It's like once we stopped living in tribes and towns got too large for everyone to know everyone else we had to create tribes of our own, and in order for these tribes to have meaning and consistency in our large society each member of these neo-tribes must conform to an even stricter set of guidelines than would be necessary in an average tribal society. It's funny how every group seems to think that they are unique and that they are true individuals, however most members of a group almost always dress the same, or at least very similarly. I swear to god that if I see one more of those 'You laugh at me because I am different, I laugh at you because you're all the same' shirts I'm going to barf all over the person wearing it and them that I'm laughing at them because they think they're 'different' while wearing a shirt that could have it's own wearers convention I've seen so many people wearing it. Every person has the capacity to have so many interests it's not funny, sometimes I think I bore people to death talking about my own, but I've noticed that many people never seem to have any real interests. It's almost like people are afraid of being kicked out of their neo-tribe if they express an interest in something that none of the others like. Each group has it's own safe area it could be literature, music, clothes, style, whatever, and you will often hear people talking about those things, but not so much about other things. I think it's important to note that I'm not talking about friends, there is a difference between a group like the neo-tribe that I'm talking about, and a group of friends. It's also important to note that my friends kick ass and that I'm not talking about any of them. However, I am talking about many people I do to school with at DVC. It's strange to walk around campus and hear people talking about the dumbest most meaningless shit. It's even stranger to try to talk with people and try to talk about meaningful things, not like the meaning of life or anything just about things that actually interest people (what they plan to do after school, where they grew up, hobbies...), and have them get all uncomfortable and leave. I don't know if people think I'm hitting on them or what but almost every time I talk to someone like an adult with full comprehension abilities rather than talk to them like they are children (how are you? I like your hat? the sky is nice...) they end up looking at me like I'm nuts. The other end of that spectrum are people that try to talk about the craziest thing they can to prove how different they are. Somehow these people annoy me even more than people that talk about nothing because it just seems that they are forcing something that isn't there. It would be as if I talked about the goatse man with everyone I met."

If my readers will remember I have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when I came to work today to find a 'Spirit Award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? The best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and I got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was I surprised."
262,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"22,June,2004","I've been working on my new game for a little while now it's coming along okay. I have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code. Recently I've been working on implementing a 2D SDL based particle engine. I've had a few problems because unless I use single pixels for particles I can't figure out how to color them. So I would have to have different particles drawn in each color I would want , or have all particles be the same color. It's so much easier to do in OpenGL. Half the game effects I have planned are particle effects so if I can't figure out how to do them in SDL I may have to do the partiels in OpenGL, I know there is a way to use OpenGL with an SDL window, I just han't read up on how yet. Right now I'm working on this game less than any others I have worked on in the past. By this point in time on my missile command clone I had already finished an OpenGl particle engine and setup all the particle effects I would use in that game. My lack of work is mostly because I spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else, aside from sleeping and 'working'. I need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds, that way I could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere. But it's too much work shuffeling code around all the time, and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files. If the USB on my home computer actually worked I guess I could just use a thumb drive to move things around. But alas it does not work. ASUS makes some great boards, but this one isn't exactly the greatest. Maybe I should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system. Hmmmm....my birthday is coming and a nice new ASUS board with a gig of RAM would look mighty fine under the tree. With a nice P4, ohh man, that would be so sweet. The only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with TWO nice P4s nad TWO gigs of RAM and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive. Well, time to go play some pool I guess. At least I did write a few lines of code today."

Even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didn't give me money for gas or the bridge. I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date. I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end. I woke up, went to Kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament. I ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of $35. Not too shabby considering that I got lucky in quite a few games. But that's just the way it goes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you...I guess I got it last night, but it wont be long before it gets me back. What a jerk. I ended the night be getting a sticky Sobe from Wolves and talking to Miss Macy for a little bit. I went home, played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep, something which I failed miserably at. It's now the morning of today and I got about one or two hours of sleep.

I wanted to do more with the past week then just hand out like normal. But It's hard to find people that want to get out and do stuff early in the day, especially when you're not so sure you want to yourself. Is it getting hotter!!! It's 4:00pm, I figured it would start cooling off but my house defies me again and shows it self for the oven that it is. Roasted griffenjam is on the menu tonight. I got the new Zelda game, Four Swords Adventures, last week. It came with a free shirt and I'm wearing it now, for the third time this week, I did wash it yesterday though so that is no excuse to stay away from me. The game is alot like the new Harry Potter movie. It's really good for what it is, but don't try to compare it to anything else in the series (or in the movies case the book) because it just wont live up. In practice it's very much like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Which was the worst Final Fantasy game ever. The thing I hat...dislike the most is that you cant just walk around the world at your leisure. You have to select a specific are to go to, then select an available section, and clear it to move on to the next area. I don't like games that are too controlling, let me do my own thing dammit. A Link to the Past kicks this games ass so hard the bruises may never go away, but like I said, it's fun for what it is. My, and Isabella's, birthday is coming up soon. I'm wondering if my dad will call, I doubt he will but I hope he does. It's normally pretty easy to milk an absent parent for good gifts or cash, as long as they feel bad about being absent. However I didn't even get a card for Christmas so I think that I may be out of luck. I wonder what the etiquette is with crappy dads when it comes to the rest of the family. My Grandmother, his mom, is having everyone at her house for her birthday soon and I was invited. I want to go, but I don't know. I always get the feeling that I'm a little set apart from them, except for Grandma. For example, I'm the only liberal in a very conservative family, I'm also the only non-baptized one. I also know that if I go I'll just get even more mad at my dad than I already am. Like last time I went up. Some cousins and I were playing softball and then one of them said something about playing softball with my dad recently. This was funny because my dad lives in Arizona and she doesn't. That means that my dad came to California and at some point played softball with her (something he hasn't done with me) and never even called me. Before that day I thought it was the entire family that he ignored but during that trip I found out that it was just me. Everyone kept asking me about what I thought about things he's been up to or have happened to him. All of it was news to me. Ohh well, what can I do, but if he thinks he's getting my liver or any other organ someday he can think again."

They tried to lie about it and say that the level of terrorism had dropped lower than it has been in 34 years, but someone called them on it and now they look pretty dumb.

Due to my non-stop lateness and over the top internet useage I've been suspended for two days. While I think that suspension was a little harsh I could use a little time off. The only thing that bugs me is that I'm not the only one in my department that does this stuff. I'm just the most obvious one. Hell one person plays flash games all day. Another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work. Ohh well, I guess that's what it means to be low man on the totem pole. Enough about that, now it's time to tell about me being hasseled by the man. The other night I was driving home from playing some pool and I see a cop driving around, I say to Isabella, 'He's going to pull me over'. Low and behold he does. I wasn't doing anything wrong, nothing at all. He tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired. Just to make it totally clear, I had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the DMV computers right in their car I find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired. He eventually lets me go. Last night, just two nights after the first incident, after leaving a pool tournament (which I didn't win) I see a cop, and he sees me walking to my car. He pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me, then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight. He's out of sight for all of five seconds and I see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute. The second I drive off he's on my ass. I LOVE it when cops tailgate me! So I try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end I kinda do. I'm at a red light and and I see a car coming but it looks far enough away that I think I can safely turn right. The cop didn't agree. He pulled me over and asked for my license. This piqued my interest because he didn't ask for my registration. I would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it, but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didn't ask for it. He just told me to yeild next time and let me go. God I love the cops in Benicia. I live in Vallejo and drive around that city all the time, at all hours but never get pulled over there. I go one town over and it happens quite often."

In my defense I've been sick lately and it's harder to get up and around early when you're sick. I don't know how to tell her that without sounding like I'm just making excuses, which is something I really don't want to do. I guess it doesn't matter really. This place isn't known for handing out raises so it's not like I'm going to miss a chance at a raise because I'm a bad employee, and I don't think I'm quite fireable yet.

When I was 17 I had the world figured out; I was the person I really wanted to be and couldn't imagine ever wanting to change. I was going race people on the feeway with my VW Bug for the rest of my life. I was going to do other things too, but I was sure that racing my bug was going to be a big part of my life forever. Well, two accudent later I no longer had a bug to race and it's really hard to look like a straigt up hardcore pimp driving a Bonneville (and it was so easy in a VW Bug!). Now that I have a car that can race I find that I never actually want to do it. Maybe I'm just afraid that I'll get in a wreck and die, I mean how fast could I really go in a VW Bug? Heh, actually it's funny for how much one changes, how much of them stays the same. I remember when I was young, maybe in third grade, I used to be afraid that when I grew older I would turn into someone else. That somehow the voice inside my head would be different and not connected to the one I had at that time. I was afraid of being older, like 15 or 16, I didn't know how to do it then. It all seemed very scarey. I would be expected to do things and know things about the world. Like how to pay taxes and register cars. I would be expected to know how to SPELL!!! Well, I guess I can't get everything right. When I made it to 15 the last thing I wanted was to be 18. There were breif moments when I wanted the freedom that being 18 would bring but those moments didn't last long. I didn't have a large college fund, $1000 doesn't even go far at community college, and I knew that none of my parents would be kicking down the many thousands that it would take to send me to school. I also knew that my grades weren't good enough to merrit and kind of scholership worth talking about. This all ment that I would have to work for a living when I turned 18 (which actually turned out to be when I was 16) and even thought I hadn't done it yet I knew one thing anout work, it was for suckers. Ten jobs later I have only confirmed that, work really is for suckers. I know that a blog is supposed to be like a diary. A log of events in your life, but I find my typical day to be too mundane to talk about. I don't mean to diminish the importance I place on hanging out with my friends thought. I saw a few of my friends yesterday and last night and I really enjoy it every time I'm around my friends. Whether it's going to the mall and getting a bit to eat or sitting around shooting pool and trying to win stuffen animals the time I spend with my friends is the most important time in my life. That is something that has never changed about me and I hope that it never does."

Unless it was after the credits the trainride home wasn't even in the movie and that means that pidwidgen (spelling?) wasn't either, sorry Ron I guess Errol will have to do for now. Quiddich was completely forgotten about after the first match, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to seeing Harry's patronus run down Malfoy. Actually many things arn't in the movie at all, which I was expecting but it seems that too much is missing. Time also seems to move very quickly. Before you know it it's christmas time, but strangely enough it never actually is christmas. It seems that opening presants on christmas is a feature of every book, but it didn't make it into the movie. Sorry guys, no sweaters from Mrs. Weasley or any other preasents . One thing I was sorry wasn't in the movie was the lack of normal interaction. You never really see the students in class unless there is a major event in that class. The books deal not only with the main story line but also with the life of Harry and his friends in school, this is something that is completely missing from the movie. I still liked it none the less."

Ladt night is a perfect example. I had a dream that I was arrested for some reason and thrown into jail, this was a lucid dream, however it's hard to take control when you don't realize that you have any; I thought it was real. I was totally freaking out, wondering what the hell was happening. However it was that bad because every time I wanted anything I would find it right away. I was a little thirsty and instantly found a coke machine, I wanted something to do and found a rec-room filled with pool tables. I wanted something to eat and I just all of a sidden had food, I don't even know where it came from. After a little while it turned out that I was in the coolest jail ever. Somehow I missed that fact that there was a surprisingly small number guys in this jail and the majoiry of the population was filled with hot girls. How did I not reailze that I was dreaming. I'm staying home from work today, my sickness I mentioned before has not gone away and I figure that if I have to deal with it for a while I may as well take a day of work. This sucks more than is immedatly apperent to anyone that doesn't work for communists. At the hospital I for at your sick time and your paid vacation all come out of the same bucket. The time I'm taking now is subtracting from my paid vacation time....that is so lame it makes me even sicker. It's actually a very bad policy to have in a hospital. I wonder how many people, in order to conserve vacation time, go to work sick....in a hospital...go to work sick...sick...to their work....their work which is where tons of people are that shouldn't be around anyone that is sick that they don't have to be. Ohh well, I don't make the rules, I just try my best to not follow them. I saved some of the best news for last. Last night I won a pool tournament. Brought in a wooping $69. Woohoo! Actually I got quite lucky, and you can believe me when I say that because I think false modesty is one of the fakest things since McDonalds cheeseburgers. It really rips me up when I know that someone is trying to be modest and saying things I know they really don't think. Well, I have to go, I told Isabella and MaterialGirl that I would come hang with them. Don't do anything I wouldn't do....and if you do call me first so I can come and watch..."

I couldn't sleep at all last night and when I did drift off for a short period of time I had a strange dream about Optimus Prime and I hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital I work in. It seemed that most of the Autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us. Optimus wasn't in high spirits and neither was I. So, I'm tired and cranky and I have a sore throat and so when I got to work I decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day. Budget cuts at school have now hit home for me. There is a greatly decreased number of Tuesday/Thursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arn't teaching the classes I need to take, which is okay because the classes arn't at time I can take them anyways. Why is it patriotic to blindly support every war Bush takes us into but it's okay to let education funding slide. Wanna talk about patriotism, how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change. Our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that don't care about funding education. I was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but I just got blindsided by my bad day. I need to talk to a counselor about what classes I can take for my major now that I can't take the math class I need or the programming class I need."
272,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"27,July,2004","Last sunday was the anniversary of the day of my birth. It's not a global holiday yet, but I'm working on it. I had a pretty good time. I had gone to Lake Tahoe with my parents, my sister and her husband. I won some money on the first night I was there, that was pretty cool. We went to Nevada and saw some sights, including the town that Bonanza was filmed in. Then we came back and went out on a dinner cruise in the lake. It was pretty cool. The food was alright except for the fact that no matter how anyone ordered the steak it came out medium well. But considering that it also came out within five minutes of ordering it I have an inkeling that it may have been already cooked and would have been hard to uncook it a little to make it med. rare. The boat sports a small glass bottom that is too small to be of any use to anyone that isn't just trying to check on the color of the water under the boat. But it was a nicvee trip altogether and I enjoyed the views of the lake. I took lots of pictures, as people normally do in that kind of setting, then in five years I'll probably do what countless others have done, I'll look at those pictures and wonder where the hell they were taken and what exactly I was taking a picture of, because aside from trees and water there is nothing remarkable in the pictures. After we got back we all went gambling. The idea was to go together but we ended up going our seperate ways after long. I did well but wasn't making the millions I wanted to so I quit and walked to a pub that sports a pool table and figured I'd shoot a couple games. This was a great decision it turns out, because I met two very nice girls from Oakland in the pub. We shot a few games then decided to go gamble a little, but on the way to the casino stopped off at a club called the Cabo Yabo or something or other. Now, I don't drink, smoke, or have sex with everyone I meet so the clubs have never really been my thing but we were having a good time none-the-less. I turned 26 standing in that club. We stayed there for a little over an hour then went to do some gambling. I lost a little money ($6.50). And at 2:30am figured that it was time to go to bed. I bid my new friends farewell and left for the warm, if not lsightly stiff, embrace of my bed in my temporary home. I should have gotten their numbers but I didn't. Ohh well, maybe I'll see them again. In the morning I went to a breakfast buffet with my family and had a pretty good breakfast. After that we gambled a little more, I lost thirty dollars. Then everyone left, one group at a time, with me leaving last. I came home ans went out with some friends to a local bar. Aparentally I spent the whole night muggin' (staring in a menacing way) people, or so I was told, repeatadly."
273,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"23,July,2004","For those that don't know, and since everyone that reads this knows me I'm talking to no one that's likely to see this, I play in a pool tournament every thursday night. Last week I did pretty bad, the word dismal comes to mind. Losing is one thing, but missing a bunch of easy shots is another. To put it plainly; I just plain sucked. However this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because I came out swinging this time and I was dropping fools like that's what they were made for. Well, I guess I could remember it that way if I were drinking or doing some heavy drugs. In reality I got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person I was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave. My luck ran out in the last two games. This is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket. This means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket, which is exactly what happened, with a little help from me. For me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game. The eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and I had a clear shot at it. I took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that I didn't follow it into the side pocket and took my shot. I had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner. Ohh well, it happens. Sometimes I feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways. And that's all I have to say about that."
274,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"22,July,2004","So, today I did stupid shit like waking up and going to work and coming home and stuff, then I did something pretty cool. I went to see some bands play at Blakes in Berkeley. I ended up going by myself which is cool with me, but stuff like this is always more fun with friends. Ohh well, at least no one I know saw me jogging down telegraph trying to find a place with a public bathroom I could take a crap in and not die from some disease five minutes later. I got there rather early and the show started rather late, which ment that I did alot of standing around outside by myself before the show started. Yet again, I don't mind being alone. My dislike for humanity as a whole compells me to no talk to most other people and since I'm a pretty momentumy person my non-talkingness carries over to pretty much everyone, even people I might like to meet. However this doesn't stop crazy people from talking to me and telling me about how they think that Kurt Cobain was alot like Earnest Hemmingway because both blow their brains out. But figuring that you just have to take it as it comes I just smile and say something like 'Wow, I never saw it that way.'. The bartender at blakes, the girl that works on the main level, has a very strange thing going on. I normally have a pretty good feeling about what people are like, what kind of person they are and so on, and this girl game me a really strange feeling, but in a good way, kind of like the Buddah or something. I wanted to ask her a bunch of questions and try to figure her out but I figured that some creapy guy in a green hat asking where she grew up and what her favorite color is might seem at best like I'm some creapy guy that is hitting on her, and at worst like some creapy loser that is wearing a strange hat and hitting on her. She was also cute and smiled alot, I like people that smile at people they don't know, I do it all the time but rarely get one in return. The first band that played was pretty good. There were from the East Coast and played something that sounded very much like L.A. ska. I don't remember their name though and I didn't care to get their CD I kinda had the feeling that they were jerks. This was confirmed when I saw them mocking the band that played after them, Sputter Doll. Sputter Doll played a great set, I really loved it. I felt kind of bad though because all the other bands were pretty much straight ska bands and here they were playing punk. I got the feeling that most of the people there weren't really digging on them too much, which is too bad because they sounded great. I wanted to get their new CD but they packed up and left before the band after them finished their set. Which brings me to Warsaw. I got a Warsaw Cd back in '97 and thought they were pretty cool. I had no idea they were still around untill today. They played a great set with a bunch of original sounding ska, and even had someone playing a conch shell in one song. It was great to see all the people dancing and haveing a good time, I know I was. However I really had been hoping to hear some of the songs on the CD I have, but they only played recent stuff. Ohh well. Like I said, gotta take it like it comes, no use complaining about it. After they were done I left, I didn't really care to stick around for the next band. I drove to the Pastime to play a little pool. Which is exactly what I did, play a little pool; two games to be exact. Once I got there I realized that I was too tired to stay for long. I played and them came home, sucessfully getting out of Benicia without getting pulled over."
275,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"12,July,2004","Last night I was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago, just over ten years ago in fact. It's about the first time I fell in love, or at least thought I did. I'll leave out many of the boring details because I'm told that they, rather than adding depth and interest, just make my stories long and drawn out. I was a youngster staying at a hotel/casino with a parent. This meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever I didn't have shit to do. However I was a horny youngster so I went to hand out by the pool, I didn't have a swimsuit, but I figured that girls probably did. Well, while sitting by the pool I noticed a girl around my age, who actually turned out to be a couple years younger, sitting with her grandparents. She was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way; I couldn't really put my finger on it or figure out why I thought she was so attractive but you don't really questions those things too much do you, if you think someone is hot you don't really care why. Well, being a little wuss I knew that I wouldn't talk to her, especially no in front of her grandparents, so I didn't really think about it. Now, it becomes important to point out that I am, and always have been, a big ice eater. In my earlier years it wasn't uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while, something that I did at exactly this point in my story. I got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down. About five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well, on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was. This shocked the hell out of me because at that point, and to a certain degree to this day, I had the feeling that I was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless I walked into someone or something. At that moment nothing more came of that. Her grandparents and her eventually got up and left, I had nothing to do so stayed there for a while. There was a view of the river nearby from the pool area, so I checked that out for a while. I eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere. I left the pool area and hit the elevator button, which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area, when I heard someone say hi to me from behind. It was that girl, we talked for a little bit (untill the elevator got there). It turned out she was waiting for her grandparents. When the elevator arrived I really wished I could keep talking to her but I didn't know if I would look crazy if I called up an elevator and didn't get into it so I left. I kicked myself all the way to whereever I went after that. I did something, ate dinner, blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed. I told my parent that I wanted to go for a walk, which was true. I was told to be back by 10pm. I went back to the pool, mostly because I wanted to see the girl, but also because I enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars, even to this day I can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored. When I got there I found that I was the only one there, I sat down and thought about things for a while, then a door opened and she came out. We talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff. I found out that she was from Seattle and her grandparents lived in Sacramento. I can't remember her name (I'm terrible with names) and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address. When midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms. I was happy that I had met such a cool person but sad because I knew I would never see her again. I was actually depressed about this for a few days. I wrote in a journal at this time in my life and I'll repete here the advice I wrote in my journal. If you take the time to get to know the perfect person, at least make sure to get her address."

I do it a little at a time, I'm not a very hardcore developer these days. Think I got this far with Earth Defender B within the first two or three days.

Since I don't do much artistically that I can share with others I figure all I really have right now is my games so I'm going to post a screenshot so all can see my fledgeling game in all its glory.

277,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"08,July,2004","Well, I'm trying to sign up for classes and I'm having some problems. It seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes I want are at times I can't take them. I can accept this, for now. So I'm thinking that I will talk to a counselor and see what classes I need that are in times I can take them. So I call up and try to make an appointment. This was my big mistake. I expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense (give advice to students before a semester starts). I was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes. So in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and don't really need help. I was told that I couldn't make an appointment until school actually started, and even then I can only make the appointment once school starts, it would be weeks before I could actually see one. WTF!!! So they only counsel people that have already made mistakes. Hey, glad you made an appointment to come see me, ohh look at this, you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester, should have talked to someone before signing up for these, but now it's too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week... THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! Why only help people after it's too late for the help to do any good! Why are there no sections of Calculus III at a time when I can take them, not only at DVC but also at Contra Costa Community College, Solano college, and Napa College. Are there any others I can try? And I'm tired of people that use its when they mean it's, if you want to say it is use IT'S DAMNIT!!! The same goes with your, and you're. And what's with Yellow Cabs anyways, so what if it's yellow, doesn't have to be in the damn name does it!"
278,3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"06,July,2004","I just read this and found it pretty sad. This kid wants to go kill Muslims. That's it, kill Muslims. God I hope they don't let him into any branch of the armed forces, just what we need, some kid with his own Muslim killing agenda. This is sad on so many levels it's not even funny. Normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it. Normally fear that these people aren't actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can. How many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems...not alot, because they know they are secure in their job and aren't afraid that someone that isn't acclimated to the culture and can't speak the language well is going to come and take their job away. As far as I'm concerned if you can be replaced by someone that can't speak English and only just got here then you probably didn't deserve your job in the first place. I also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals. I'm sorry but you can't go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next. Illegals work harder for less money than most of this country, they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place. They embody free market capitalism, they risk everything for a shot at a better life, and they are willing to work hard for it. And because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables. I don't hear anyone complaining about that, you never hear anyone say 'Damn those illegals, these oranges should cost 10 times this much!!!'. The funny part of it is that we, as a country, support the illegals every day. If you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it. Do you shop at Walmart? Guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals. Just like my answer to anything you don't like in our society, if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott. If you don't like illegals then don't buy anything they pick, shop anywhere they clean, or pay them for anything. Personally I don't care about illegals, like I said, I know they aren't taking my job. And I'm pretty secure in knowing that most Americans are too lazy, stupid, and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal 'problem' so all they will keep doing is talking shit. Another thing I love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on Earth just because they are born here. I'm sorry, but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they don't deserve to live here. I've got news for you kid, no one born deserves to live here, some of us are just lucky. And before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party I have to ask you, what have you done to make this country great? People go on and on about how great this country is, and I don't disagree, this is a great country, but it's not through their actions that it's great. It's thanks to people like Thomas Edison, The Wright brothers, and, thought I REALLY hate to say it Henry Ford that this country is great. It has nothing to do with John Q. Asshole that does alot of talking but doesn't do shit worth talking about, every country has those. Until you do something worth talking about I don't really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldn't because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the U.S. to maintain it's dominance in the world. It always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them."

I wont go into all the specifics but I hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw La Plebe play at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of Oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, Charlotte, is starting to like me but Maggie still seems pretty wary of me. I got to see two parades this year, Vallejo and Benicia's. I think I can say without too much hometown bias that Vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that Benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in Vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat Vallejo's handsdown though. In Vallejo the Vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In Benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that Benicia is missing and that is a Ducky Durby. I know I bought a duck from a person in Vallejo's parade, thought I didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, I don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address. Well, this was a great weekend and I'm glad that I got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because I would know that I had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to."

Since I posted that screenshot I have added such wonderfull and awe inspireing things as bullets, and one enemy that doesn't have the ability to fire at you yet, which is okay because it's mostly just a flying bomb itself, it has been named a spin-drone. Mostly because it's a drone, and it spins, or it should. Right now it just looks like a tweeker robot thing that is makeing strange movements that don't really resemble spinning at all. I am such a bad pixel artist it isn't even funny. Well, for other people it's funny, and I guess I do laugh sometimes at my own crappy art, so I guess I should say that i'm such a bad pixel artist that it's only occasionally funny, and most time the horrors oof my art are beyond humor. Maybe I'm going over the top a little, but I don't think so. I'd post another screenshot but I'm lazy and no one would care so why bother. Plus the game isn't that visually different yet. I need to work on the HUD a little more and take all the debugging text of the screen, and add another enemy or two, then I'll post another screenie for you all to ignore. BTW if anyone that may be reading this is a pixel artist and wants to have their name in the credits of this game post your e-mail addy and I'll get back to you. A large chunk of the coding for this game is done, everything I have do has been done with the idea of code re-use in mind. All I have to do is add support for a few things and the buld of the game will be finished, so if an artist were to join up now if would be quick easy game credits to show their art in action.

It was a great success. On Tuesday LoveLostLibra came with my and we made the rounds hitting up every booth we could, gaining information and looking for cheap crap like it were the holy grail. Some products I had a real interest in, Blackduck had a pretty cool app for programming teams, and others that I couldn't care less about, ahem...veritas..., but only talked to to get the cheap crap. LLL and I had a pretty good time, I think (maybe he's really plotting to get back at me for boring him to tears for bringing to a Linux trade show, who knows), Intel threw a pretty nice after-party that had some great food and a pretty cool 80's cover band. They also had a bunch of free-to-play pool tables. We all had great fun and ate and drank and were merry and stuff. Then we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit, it's a train) back to where I parked earlier. Let me tell you that was the longest BART ride I ever had. I had to pee so bad my teeth were swimming in it. I ended up having to go in the women's restroom because there was someone in the men's room and there was no time for politeness for formality. If the women's had been locked I would have been peeing into a trashcan or something. Thursday I went back to Linux world on a solo mission of justice. I had been cheated of a great bounty of cheap shit the previous trip and I was coming back to clean house, and clean house I did. Four T-shirts, a bank, a mini-USB hub, enough mints and pens to make Mr. T cry. I especially liked the end of the conference on this, the last, day. The roles were reversed, vendors were practically begging people to take their stuff so they wouldn't have any left over. I can't think of one piece of swag that I missed. There was no after party however, ohh well. Can't win em all ehh? For lunch I ate at a 'Mexican' restaurant in the Metreon. I had a chicken quesadilla and a Sobe, it came to just over $9.00. While eating I was forced to think about the Mexican place I recently ate at in the Mission. This food was bland and almost tasteless, and very expensive, while the food server just a couple miles away was authentic, real, and not very expensive at all. It made me sad to think that things would be so watered down for the people ate at this place. What mostly made me sad was how much I paid for this crappy food. How lame..."

First off you have Papa smurf. He takes care of all the smurfs and coordinates the resources of the entire village. He also wears a RED hat, what a fucking commie. All of the smurfs have names that denote what they do in the village. Handy smurf, Heafty, Brainy (?), ect. They all do something, even if it's only just stand there and look good and no matter what they do they all get the same reward for their work. They all have the same house, the same food, and they all want to get some from smurfette but she aint givin' up to any of them. I don't know what that has to do with communism, but it still sucks all the same. Now this brings us to Gargamel. This is where it gets deep. Gargamel is a capitalist that is always trying to make some cash by turning the smurfs into gold. Or to put it more simply, he wants to make money off of the hard working smurfs. If that doesn't scream bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat I don't know what does. I don't know what the hell those two prince kids represented, but I'm sure it's something communist."

I got the idea from my friend Jeff Yen who picks a random word from a dictionary and writes a journal entry on it.

285,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"27,May,2002","Doli Incapax and the 50-egg cake I was at my friend Joy's Blog the other day, and read something interesting, called doli incapax . Basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility can't be held accountable for wrongful actions/ crime that they commit 'coz they can't yet tell right from wrong, and may not understand what they're doing. Just what is the 'legal age of responsibility'? Hmm...maybe the argument can be used for certain *ahem* 22 year-olds? I'd love to plead that case. Especially for me, the bumbly butter-fingered buffoon . Well, it was Shawn's 24th B'day party today, though his b'day's tomorrow (that's the surprise!), and I kept doing bumbly things. Like dropping Joy's camera (classic 3 stooges stuff), biting into my plastic fork, and worst, accidentally hitting E-Gene's still-recovering-from-ligament-operation knee. ARGF. After I was so careful not to. (He was in pain - you should've seen his face.) Oh and did I forget to mention that I left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through it's own rubber insulated wiring? How one day can go so wrong I don't know...sigh... And it's not just today. It's EVERYDAY. I'm constantly making a fool of myself, either putting my foot in my mouth or causing/being involved in accidents. Charles says I should just try to be more aware, but as you can see from the knee hitting incident, it makes no difference. I'm just bumbly lil' ol' me. Ah wells..... Enough of my whinging and whining... Shawn's party was pretty great, organised by his girlfriend Joy. We stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches, pasta and nachos. BURRRRP. And of course, later, the DENSEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. It must have had 50 over eggs in it (I'm extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of Peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it. I'm not kidding.) ACK...feeling the pain now... I think the highlight of the party has to be the 'What do I hate/love about Shawn part' where everyone got to air their grievances. For more information, check out his Blog . Let's just say we had a ball of a time...hee hee hee... Whatever it is, we all had a great time. Too bad Shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after. :-) Now THAT'S what I call a good party, when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration. (No lah, he's not that pathetic...he was only let in on it 'coz there was no way to get him out of the way. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! doodeedoodeedoo... His pasta was pretty good though.) Bit of a borin' ol' read innit? All rights, that's all for today. Sorry it's a bit of a boring read so far, only 'coz I'm too busy/lazy to write with my usual *ahem* creative flair. Tune in after I finish me essays for a more updated look to this site, and hopefully I'll be able to add more interesting links n stuff."

287,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"23,May,2002","Big Event E-Gene had his knee operation today, to fix his torn ligament (soccer soccer soccer...the bane of all knees...) Went with him in the morning, and checked into St Vincent's Private. Not bad - the room is pretty retro - the wallpaper, floor, TV etc. He has his own room and bathroom, so it's cool. The meals are pretty good - I know 'coz i ate his! (MMMM....yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce, caesar salad, bread roll with butter, fruit salad, fizzy lemonade and clear consomme.) He wasn't allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia. He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm. Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed 'seeing him off' to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm. He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident... Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page! Just a quick update on my iBook situation. Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook. It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule! Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had. Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem. (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?) The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those 'dude' IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying 'no dramas' meaning 'no problem'. So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha... Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up..."
288,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"20,May,2002","It hasn't been a good day. Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!) I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend. Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH. Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!! I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!) I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it. Sigh...why don't I ever learn?"
289,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"19,May,2002","AAARRRGGGHHHHHHHHGGGGHHHHHH I dropped my iBook. My precious precious iBook. On the ground. From a chair. I knocked it over. By accident. Honest. Ack! Now my Microsoft Word application won't open, and certain folders in the Finder can't be opened either. And I have 3 MAJOR essays due soon. HELP!! I'm almost in tears. This is terrible. And I really wanted to finish an essay by today so I could start on the rest. But I guess it's not meant to be. The scary thing is, I think I may have to send it into the Apple Store and get it fixed, and they might wanna change the hard drive or something. Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff. WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW?? I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something. Either that or I should just be less lun-zun . Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always lun-zun ;-) Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents. But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it. Or Can You?? I don't know. I really don't know. As a famous man once said, So Help Me God!!"

Anyways, am eating butter and sugar on bread right now - the poor man's brekky hehe. But it really doesn't taste fantastic on sourdough bread. My advice is, stick to plain ol' white 'lo-ti'. I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in. My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too. He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz... Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait! As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss. All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system.

But i bought like 7 items, so that was pretty worth it (usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear...). So yes, am pretty happy. Going crazy shopping i know. I spent 2 hrs there, SOLELY in the lingerie section, while poor Charles had to wander around the department store alone...poor guy. But all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job. Eeeks..praying for a good and fun one. Anyways, we had a nice night after all that shopping...came back to Homebush (my old apt. where Wally, E-Gene and Shawn still reside) and cooked dinner, then had our Monday TV night. Yay, nothing like good food and good company (friends and the telly heehee). Tomorrow my friend Joanne's supposed to arrive from Canberra for a visit. That should be fun!

But it's the hols now, at least till 29 July! Been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th. Went skiing at Mt. Buller with E-Gene's family, and that was really fun. His whole family was there, including his sis and bro-in-law and nephew. Boy, the baby's cute! His name's Ethan, and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would, but sadly...need to find erm, some server or something b4 i can upload pics right? (Hmm... i think i can put it up on my mac site...will check that out.) Anyways, skiing was really fun, had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe....would have loved to ski more, or at least try a longer distance, but it wouldn't have been much fun without E-Gene around...he couldn't ski 'coz he didn't want to risk injuring his knee again. Watched the England-Brazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon (the telecast here was at 4.30pm). The crowd was a good mix of Brazilian and English fans, so there was an equal amount of cheering going on. We had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city, but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away. So we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead. The match was pretty exciting. Let it be known, I'm not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer, but i do enjoy watching the game now and then, especially between good teams. But i think i still prefer watching it by myself, or with a smaller group of people. I guess when you don't share as much passion about the team as the VB-drinking bloke next to you, it's hard to cheer the team on (and in the process slosh beer on your clothes). But there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too, watching the game, having chips and wedges and the occasional Lemon Ruski. They looked as out of place as I did, me with my calm claps, plastic smile, and feeling torn between rooting for England (which my friends were, and i'm 'supposed' to by default as E-Gene is a Liverpool fan...), and Brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills. Plus Brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after Owen's goal. (AND!! Ashley Cole wasn't too friendly to Ronaldinho who'd placed his hand on the former's shoulder as a friendly gesture, or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least, only to have Cole shove his arm away. Plus Cole was equally rude to other players later on. erm, if anyone disagrees, drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette Which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the Brazilian players after a while...) Well, two Bacardi Breezers and many contraband hot peanuts (we bought some from the Asian grocer and snuck them in) later, Brazil's in the semi's for the World Cup. No surprises there i guess, although it would've been nice to see England in the semis after all this time... Wow...i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh? Amazing... Oh wells, anyways, it being the hols and all, i'm trying to find a job now. Either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something. Both seem pretty fun to me... :-) Less boring than an office job. But i need a good environment (pple and boss must be nice), good flexible hours (so i can still enjoy the hols, and spend time with my sis when she comes over), and good pay (not too worried about that, pay here is pretty decent, from $10-15 at least, depending on the job). So praying for opportunities... All rights, almost 1am now, am planning to go to church tomorrow (after a looooong hiatus...bad huh?) so gotta go sleep! Nites! Okies, it's late.

302,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"31,July,2002","We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story! This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta. The allergy symptom is described as a 'red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck.' The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe. According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a 'walking asthmatic lobster with bumps', she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and 'wind' in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort. Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment. According to Miss Wong, 'My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried.' After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night. 'I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it.' After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week. 'I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?' 30 July 2002 We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme..."

Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact. Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all. Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!! There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here! Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the 'concubine' you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the 'wife', the one he's married to, while Shawn's the 'mistress', the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever... No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too. Miss his sudden rants about society's faults and the various places in Melbourne which are 'a bloody rip-off!!' Welcome back Shawn."

308,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"25,July,2002","Chaddy and Dandenongnongnenong I had a truly wonderful time today. Woke up, went shopping in Chadstone Shopping Mall with my sis, and then drove to Mt. Dandenong where I had terrific devonshire scones, the hugest sundae you've ever seen, and lovely asparagus, chicken and cheese fingers, accompanied by Taylor's tea. Yummm.... Not by myself of course - with E-Gene, Tess and Charles. Later, it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner, which unfortunately i cracked much later that night. (No fear, it's still usable - one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish). Added to the depletion in my wallet's funds was the $$ spent on a nice new 3-for-the-price-of-2 book at Border's, which turned out to have a 20% discount for Uni students today. (Charles and EG returned at night to make more purchases). And that was my day. Tomorrow should be fun as well - prepping for a b'day party for my sis, who turns 19, and who'll be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today. It'll be a medium-small affair - about 10 pple for a potluck dinner. Little cocktail sausage hors d'ouevers anyone? But tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day I'll see my sis for a really long while. She'll be in Bristol from September/October onwards, for the next 3 years. But she'll be back at least once a year, so that'll be good. Am planning to visit her in Bristol one day, so we can get a Euro Rail pass and travel round Europle. Excitement! Having Tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow. In many ways we're so much alike, bumbling, making mistakes as we find our way through life, and it's hard when I realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when I do it too. Ack. Plus I also seem to nag a lot at her hehe...(which incidentally is very much the same way EG used to nag at me). As she puts it, I tend to treat her like a living doll, often mothering, (even smothering?) her. I guess 'coz I'm too used to being the older sis. Am trying to let go I guess. One thing's for sure though, I'm definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on Friday. I can imagine it now, me blubbering away at the airport. Eeek. Really for all the stuff that irritates me when she's here, like not having my own space, small quibbles about inane stuff, I really love having my sister around. Especially 'coz we both share the same warped sense of humour (we're the only 2 idiots who laugh at each other's half-assed jokes, which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people). Underneath certain differences, we get each other. Plus it's also cool when we can trick other people over the phone 'coz we both sound the same. Muahahahah.... Ah well, mushy eh? Ahhh, I can still recall the times when we'd fight and scratch and pull each other's hair. Woohooo... Time to sleep.My bed awaits."

It's a way of life!! (Note to readers: I still have absolutely no idea what Namu is. A term purportedly invented by my sis, it still dares to do the unthinkable and defy definition. One up for the think-out-of-the-box-ers) ."
310,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"09,July,2002","Tess and Tas In the last few weeks I can safely say I was never for a moment bored. Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...) School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting. On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack.... Going to Chadstone ('the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere') and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character. Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me. I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage. Woah nelly...) Not that I'm really a fan actually. I just watch it once in awhile when I happen to flip the channel. Demons and witches, pardon me for my lack of liberal-minded thinking, still pretty much freak me out. They might seem harmless on TV, with their wisecracks and all, but that's what the Devil wants you to think doesn't he? Hmmm... Anyways, time to sleep. Wondering if I should bother to sign up for the Melbourne Blog Meetup or not. Hmm... Ciao bella!"
311,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"09,July,2002","The Name Game I like the name Aidan (Ay-dun). Guess it must be all that Sex and the City that I've been watching. I dunno. It just has a nice ring to it doesn't it? I also like the name Arian, or Arienne, or whatever spelling permutations there are. Pronounced Ari-ahn . Or maybe Ari-ann . Nice name for kids don't you think? I can imagine yelling at them to tell 'em dinner's ready. AHHH RIIIIII!!! or DANNY!! Sounds nice eh? Although I also would like calling my kid by his/her initials too, which is why a middle name is needed. Like CJ or AJ or KC or something. hehe... i once thought of calling my daughter Caitlin Josephine just so i could shorten it to CJ. E-Gene, sadly, thought naming his kid Aidan Samuel Soh would've been a laugh (yeah we both like the name Aidan. Whoever gets a boy first gets that name! dammit...tick tock tick tock...). Can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground? Who wants his kid's initals to be ASS??!! Wah lau eh...damn cruel... Ah wells, who gets the male mind eh?"

I don't understand why I'm so edgy. I just am. And it's annoying that it just comes out in tight-lipped strained tones when I speak. I apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today. I hate that i can't express myself properly, fully, and without whining. As one of my good friends Michelle says, 'Sarah and whining just go together, but we accept it i suppose. It's part of you.' Sigh. Sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hard-core sailor blush."

314,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"02,July,2002","Coffee, Tea or Me? Thaaaaaaat's right. I'm becomin' a *ahem* barista, or in more colloquail terms, ka-fei mei . Yep, just applied at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf round the corner from my place, and hopefully will get a job there, serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes. Yay...can't wait. No seriously. I can't wait. Need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping, eating and taking public transport. You'd be amazed at how much I spend a week. Not to mention groceries, rent and phone bills. But being a ka-fei mei isn't too bad an idea. I don't really mind it actually, mostly 'coz the hours are flexible, you get to interact with people and you aren't stuck behind a desk and computer. It's fun actually, which is why I'm pretty excited about it, IF I get the job. The funny thing about Melbourne is, to get any job, you've gotta have a resume. EVEN for part-time work at coffee joints. Strange huh? Back home they just make you fill up a form, and if you look pleasant enough, speak good english, and can tell the difference between a mocha ice-blended and a mocha caramel ice-blended (it's the caramel, duuhhh ), you're a shoo-in for the job. Here, they get you to fill in a form, and a resume with REFERENCES mind you, people they can call to vouch for you, just in case you're a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot Special Dutch Chocolate. Can you just imagine that? Sttstttsttt....must get foam just right, stttststttt, just right, caramel mocha, mocha...waitaminit. Did she just give me FIVE CENTS LESS? Hey lady, you're five cents SHORT. It's four ninety-FIVE lady, FIVER at the end lady, heard that? Says so on the screen! FIVE CENTS LADY! FIVE CENTS GEDDIT? FIIIIIVVVEEE CENTS!! FIIIIIVVVVVEE WHOLE CENTS!!!! What, you don't know how to count huh? AHHHHHHHHH!!! and I suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers, screaming like a banshee, spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere, a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple. Phew! Erm, in case my future employers are somehow reading this, I'm NOT REALLY INSANE. I've NEVER been institutionalised at a mental hospital before (unless you count my secondary school years...) Thank you. Just needed to clear that up. Well, the job's all in God's hands. Praying for it, and going by faith. I really want a job that has a good working environment, good colleagues and boss, good flexible hours, and good pay (it's pretty standard pay here - The Bean'll prob. pay me about $10-12 an hour, a rate I'll never get back in S'pore!). Hours-wise, i wrote on my application form that i'd prefer the morning 7am-12pm slots Tues to Fridays (although negotiable), simply 'coz that frees up the rest of the day, and my sis is coming to visit. And i don't really have to wake up that early 'coz i live pretty near. So praying! They'll probably call me soon to arrange an interview. I'll sell the fact that I can spell most people's names, an asset when writing them down on the plastic ice-blended cups. (can you imagine? The Bean at Junction 8 Bishan spelt my name as Sey-la! Wah lau eh....) Okies. gtg now. Nite nite. Drop me a flooble yah?"

Helped out with Daffodil Day, which is basically a day the Cancer Council of Victoria has to raise funds for Cancer Research. It was really fun - woke up at 6 plus am (can u believe it??!! And I'm NOT a morning person...), went down to Flinder's St. Station and sold all sorts of Daffodil-type merchandise, including pins, ribbons, pens, a cute teddy bear (which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws), a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils! I got to wear this Daffodil Day t-shirt, which I even managed to keep (though I really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in, but couldn't. Shucks....) So there we were, a bunch of girls at a table outside the station, selling stuff. 3 of us decided to wander down a lil' further, outside Maccers on Swanston St., and managed to sell quite a bit too. We even got our picture taken by this passing photog. All in all, a really fun start for yesterday. I'd definitely do it again, esp. since it was for a good cause (or as Ew Lee puts it, 'buy a daffodil, support a chawitab...a chawribaba...a cha.. ah-fegget-it, it's for Cancer Research!!') and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause.

They told me yesterday, after my shift, that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something, and would call me as and when they needed me. So now it's a casual basis kinda thing. They were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen, and I was still under shock so I didn't press for details. I figured maybe 'coz they had 2 new pple, this Shanghainese woman and man, who seemed like new partners or soemthing. Ah dunno lah. I honestly think it's a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely, YET keeping them hanging on your lil' pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone. This REALLY sucks. I mean, what the? After 2 weeks of training etc. And I really think I did pretty ok, and got along with everyone. If it was just a trial, tell me it was a trial. I shifted my classes around so I could fit the job in. Now they do this. I have a bleedin' 4 hour break on Wednesdays for goodness sake! I'd better cancel the scheduled transfer that's supposed to move $$ every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one. Was planning to put aside $$ each week, earn interest, and have $$ at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols. Now that idea's shot. Happened to my friend, who was working the Mon & Thurs shift too. This really stinks. On the upside, at least I'm using the time to get some research done. ONLY 4 weeks left. Haven't done much. Arrrghhhhh. Stomach hurts now. Gastric and wind. Am not daring to try Mylanta again. Tried 3 other forms of medication though, to no effect. Sigh. Only looking forward to the presentation for TV Cultures we've been working at. We're gonna majorly impress the pple, and whoop everyone's ass!

320,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"20,August,2002","Regret Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it never really quite comes round again? Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges. He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway. 'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?' said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head. 'You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. 'Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs,' he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand. 'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. 'No,' he replied simply. 'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts. 'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me. He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend. I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette. The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one. I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed. 19 August 2002"

Subjects this sem are TV Cultures (expert on this!!), MarComm (although unlike the one i took in Mass Comm...more theoretical), Italian National Cinema (must read up on fascism etc etc..), and Contemporary Hollywood Cinema (can someone PLEASE explain '2001: A Space Odyssey' to me please??!!) Special Mention Alert: Welcome PRIYANCA!! Yes, this is my blog....however, if you are reading this right now, get back to work!! . Tsk tsk... I wonder what AWARE would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading people's blogs instead of doing her job... tsktsk...hehehe Am v.v. tired nowadays, mostly 'coz of the early starts. Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow! The job so far is pretty cool. Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-) I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits. Phew I hoped all that made sense. Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated daily , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-) Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon... 1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices 2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh 3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek... Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows that for revenge??!! Creeeppy...'come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!' eeeek..... 4. Start on essay research, which eek, are ALL due in FIVE weeks time! (one of the classes is TV Cultures, and have been doing tonnes of research for it - heheh watching the tube that is....) 5. Finally change the 'Shpiel of the Week' And now off to bed. I hate early classes. zzzzz Drop me a flooble or SIGN MY GUESTBOOK!!"
322,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"06,August,2002","A new dawn awaits All right! I have a new job up, and it's starting tomorrow! Excitment - it's just a simple cafe job, and I'm not sure what my duties exactly are, but it's in school and it's income so I'll try my best. Really need favour in the manager's eyes! Phew, getting this job was such an ordeal, mostly becasue I've never received any replies to the resumes I sent out over the hols. But maybe it's good 'coz mebbe God wanted me to hold out for this, esp. since in school, and I got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing me-stuff, and hang out with my sis. Well, the cafe is run by these Shanghainese. I have no either what posessed me to do so, but I spoke to them in Mandarin! Argh, my half-past six broken Chinese. Eek. It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too. The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form: Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing? (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?) To which he replied: Oh, Jah-mes Teeheeheee...yeppers, Jahmes teeheeeheee He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11 a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at such an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went: Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma? (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?) Ahh..shi shi! (Yes, yes!) Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de. (I'm calling from XXX cafe.) Oh dui dui dui! (Oh yes yes yes!) Oh dui dui dui. (Was he making fun of me??) Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma? (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?) Oh hai mei you. (Oh not yet.) Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh. Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said, Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor? (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question) I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head. Hah?? (Hah??) Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor? (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?) Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language. (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.) Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba. (You can speak in English then.) Oh hao, hao. (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness) Xia ge xing qi jian. (I'll see you next week then.) Ah, dui. (Ah, yes.) E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: 'Man, your Chinese really sucks!' Sigh."

Well, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, the winner of the Great Buddy Award is none other than...drum roll please...Bharatha Moorthy of Serangoon Avenue 2!! For your compassionate concern and calling me all the way from Singapore after reading my Blog and finding out about my short hospital trip, worrying when I didn't answer the phone the first time, and for also reassuring my sister that I was all right (who incidentally didn't even KNOW what had happened 'coz she hadn't been reading my blog - so much for keeping tabs on me), I dub thee my GREAT BUDDY!

She was eating her house that's why she was ill and...and... (silence from the audience) Sigh, unfortunately My First Limerick hasn't quite taken off...no rave reviews, and recitations have been met by either puzzled looks or blank expressions.

I highly recommend it for your (easy) listening pleasure... Here's another Silly Song with Sarah!! The Brinjal Song (aka An Ode to E-Gene) You're a Purple Brinjal You like to dance and sing When you shake your brinjal butt It makes a sound that goes ding ding Ok ok I know, why is EG a brinjal? Just thought he looks like one lah. Btw, do you know the other names for Brinjal are Aubergine and Eggplant? Teeheehee...that said, I don't really like eating it, unless it's the Lasagne-version that Wally taught me to make....very very yummy! Brinjal-Lasagne Recipe 1. Fry brinjal till translucent (like how you would an onion I guess) 2. On baking tray lined with baking paper, place a layer of fried brinjal 3. Pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4. Repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5. Top off with a sprinkling of cheese (parmesan, mozzie, tasty, chedder, swiss, whatever you like) 6. Bake in oven till cheese has melted (I usually put it at a really high temperature so I don't have to wait too long...but that means you gotta watch it so it doesn't burn) Voila! Yummy brinjal-lasagne!"

Friday was spent at the DFO near Moorabin airport, with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy...got a pair of Just Jeans for $39.95, and EG bought me a pair of slippers for $12. And I got sidetracked by a $12.95 top which I was totally indecisive about, and I didn't buy in the end...was too conscious that I'd eventually decide it wasn't flattering after I bought it and wouldn't wear it in the end...eep... Yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends, a bunch I got closer to through the Alpha course we take in church. We had Yum Cha, then watched The Bourne Identity (featuring many out-of-focus shots), then watched a lil' footy (it was the Grand Final after all - the Brisbane Lions beat the Collingwood Magpies 75-66) on the big screen at Crown Casino while our friends played a lil' rapid roulette hehe... I think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around, playing cards and a lil Twister. All in all, a very enjoyable day spent with them. I know how I've totally not really felt comfortable at ACCF, primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with, mostly 'coz they were Aussie-Asian so there was a huge difference when we talked, even for simple slang terms and the wavelength. But this bunch is pretty cool - mostly Malaysians, but still got the lors and the lahs hehe... It's a great funny bunch of people - funny as in we laugh a lot. Last night me EG and Shawn (and Evie for a lil' while) played Upwords...imagine the ingenuity that is involved when you really can't build any more words...we came up with stuff like 'Quita' (for quitter, said 'hood-style), 'Sista', 'Gemz', and we allowed Shawn's 'Fie' 'coz it's Ye Olde English...hehe. I really like playing board games with people, it's fun. I remember how every birthday and Christmas 'til I was 12, I'd get my parents to bring me to Toys R Us so I could get boardgames. I had Payday, Monopoly, Go for Broke, The Game of Life, Taboo (bought it on my 12th Christmas, and am still playing the game 10 years on, even though the set is a different one 'coz I lost the old one) and lots more. I loved, and still do love, boardgames... My new obsession right now is crosswords puzzles, which I do with EG or whoever is available to hazard a guess at a seven-letter word for 'practiced boxing' (answer below*). That said, I'm stumped at an eight-letter word for 'announces'. The 6th letter is an R though...anybody can help?

Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann). The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh... Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.

Hmmm...dunno why, didn't laugh as much as I thought I would...maybe my expectations were a little high? I know, I know...how do u have high expectations when u watch Austin Powers right? But no, I actually like watching shall we say, *Doctor Evil-style finger quotes* 'stupid' movies...like American Pie, Road Trip (although Tom Green was *trey* gross) and the list goes on... Overall, i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the West-Side Story song n dance sequence... pretty nifty legwork I would say. Beyonce Knowles had great abs, bland acting - no sparkles there. The highlight was doing the typical Singaporean thing after the movie - supper! Except it was more like dinner 'coz we hadn't eaten. We took our first trip to Bismi! A regular Prata shop, in Melbourne! With yummy prata and teh tarik, and it was pretty cheap too...full meal (2 pratas n tarik) for only $4.90. Yummers... Oy...so full now... edge of puking. My sis is leaving for Bristol tomorrow night. Just reading her blog makes me sad in away, like she'll be so much further away - it's not just a 2-3hr time difference anymore (depending on daylight savings), but much much more - the other end of the world! I will really miss her. Somehow I feel and wish I could be a better sis n I dunno...be able to give her greater emotional support. I think I'm prob. one of those 'church'-type people who she referred to in her blog, who don't really know what to say and give tried-n-true advise, 'coz I probably don't understand the emotional turmoils she goes through. I'm less angsty I guess. The 2 of us are quite different in many ways, even since we were young. She tended to rebel and question the system, and still does (which i'm very proud of actually, she doesn't just accept things 'as they are', unlike me), while I just happily went about my way... sure we'd fight all the time thought - hated each other when we were kids, and I really thought she was a pest when I was in secondary school - i remember once, when i went back to get my 'O'-level results, n she popped by to find out how i did (she was in Sec 1 then), and I was like 'Why you come?...aiyah just go back to your class lah'. I guess I really hurt her then. And even when she started hanging round my friends, like the Old Awake friends, and the Tsunamit people - i guess i didn't like her infringing on my 'territory'. Irony is, she's prob closer to them now than I ever was... :-) I think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic. On a trip to China, she stood at the front of the bus, in her little white jumpsuit and rainbow-coloured checked shirt, and sang into the mike connected to the bus' audioo system, while everyone clapped and cheered along. Wah lau eh - attention seeker! haha...But there was a really sweet side to her too. We had had a fight, or a brawl should i say, what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc. I think i hit her too hard, and she started crying and ran to my mum, who took the cane out. I ran to the corner, and was really prepared for a whacking man, 'coz she really looked pissed. And then my sis ran in front of me, spread her hands out, and said 'No! Don't beat jie jie !!' So sweet right? In my head I was thinking 'Wah lau eh, trying to act again! Watch too much Channel 8 serials ....' but at the same time still relieved coz my mum's face softened....haha :-) Oh the stories of childhood. To Tess, if you're reading this b4 your flight tomorrow. Take care, God bless, and you'll do fine in Bristol. I love you very very much. Goodnight."

338,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"13,September,2002","Feminista I've recently come across this website, called Big Bad Chinese Mama . It's a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to, as the manifesto says, catch men in the act (of porn-ing). I sent the website's url round to a couple of close friends, little knowing the stir it caused. But it was a really good stir, as in we started debating about the site's effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression, whether it's too controversial and nihilistic with the male-bashing and all. This was what I wrote: In my humble opinion, I figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today. However much we can argue about gender equality, about our roles in society, about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony, she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today. (I've personally used the same approach, albiet in a less confrontational way, to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year - yes yes, boast boast teeheehee) It's a pretty in-your-face, confrontational gesture i suppose. What I think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking, through parody. Yeah, we're pretty much living in a post-everything world, post-feminist, post-modern yadayada. The fight has been fought, the battle has been somewhat won, but the war for equality still goes on (wow, how prosaic...). Like Velle said, the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide; i think it's all down to the whole personal-as-political approach again - i.e. if you feel that women and men play diff roles, so be it. If you feel we should use whatever power we have (sexual or otherwise) to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within , so be it. Personally, I'm more of the humour-works-to-deconstruct kinda thing. Mostly 'coz (a) my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image (yes i can hear the coughs in the background! i know who you are!!), and (b) i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn, i'm proud of it! Also, i think the fact that we're debating and thinking about it (the website as well as feminism at large) legitimises the topic anyways - yay! one up for the womyn!! Another point I want to make is also this: The fact is, that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism, or taking up the cause or whatever. When we discuss women's issues casually, (even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem), and I say that i'm a feminist, it's always greeted with a blank stare and 'oh, so what do you do?'. Everyone equates feminism with activism and the bra-burning butch stereotype. I think feminism today is more subversive, and with the use of new technology (unfortunately a world equated with the techno-geeks-are-usually-men idea), that's what bigbadchinesemama.com aimed to do. I mean I told my friend I use to clean my boyfriend's bathroom for him, and she said 'oh, you're definitely not a feminist that way'. I had to explain, firstly I liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way (must be all the fumes i've been inhaling from the Jif bottle), and secondly he wasn't free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agent's inspection, and thirdly it's nice to do something for someone, man or woman. If she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her, I would have (if and only if it wasn't in too deplorable a shape!!!). Sigh...the defences we have to keep coming up with...

It was pretty far from Melbie though, in Upper Plenty, so far it was hardly on the Melway map. Eep. But the place was so fantastic! The dorm rooms, the toilet, all really neat and clean, esp. the bathroom. All the amenities you needed, great food plus A REAL FIREPLACE. What more could you ask for!?!! We spent the 2D/2N there enjoying each other's company, and learning more about the Holy Spirit - part of the Alpha course I'm taking at church, sorta like a foundation back-to-basics of Christianity kind a thing. Real good stuff. EG had a great time too. Probably 'coz there was some serious male bonding going on. Him and a bunch of other like-minded noisy guys, sitting around after lunch, talking about cars n stuff. SO blokey...I made my friend Alan promise never to turn into them, guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe. He said no guarantees there. Sigh. What happened to all the Sensitive New Age Guys? One highlight was learning Mafia, this really interesting game where someone gets 'killed' and you gotta find out who did it. Think Murderer meets Bluff meets Survivor and you get the gist. 3 Mafiosi, 1 Doctor, 1 Spy, and the rest are Civilians (9 people in all, plus 1 Game-master). You should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out. VERY layered game, and you never know who's bluffing. Very fun, and also very interesting 'coz you've got this group of Christians who are essentially lying to each other...hmmm....hehe Anyways, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely do it again if I had the chance.

To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune. Here's a sample: (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head') I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream Also: (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive') I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J.

345,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"30,October,2002","The Day When Many Things Happened Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start... 12 pm Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick. So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, 'That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger'. Was it Arnie? I don't remember. So I decide to just pick one of the topics, Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English. Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God. 1.30 pm Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said 'Anonymous', so it was from a private number. 'Hello? Is this Sarah?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?' In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me. 3.15 pm Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class! 3.25 pm Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works. 3.55 pm Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub. Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures. 4.00 pm Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny. 8.00 pm Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!! 8.30 pm Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, 'Two's Company' (at least that's what I think the title is). 9.45 pm JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!! It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night. Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into 'John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version'. Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so ngim-jim over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica? Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. 'How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?' 'No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?' 'Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?' Hehe. Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee! Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission - apparently the GA ones are sold out. BOOHOOOOOO). 11.50 pm Walked out of HiFi Bar. 2.26 am Just finished this Blog entry. Going to sleep now. Nitey nite, I've an interview in the morning. 29 October 2002"

Speaking of which, there's a new ad on TV right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot - for some sorta baby monitor by Fisher and Paykel I think. Not sure - if anyone has seen it, let me know. It's essay crunch time again, which means I've been piahing or at least trying to piah for my essays, 1 due next Friday, and 3 due the following Friday. As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing. On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite bibik in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time. Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications. On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it! Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe. Tata Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless."
349,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"13,October,2002","Bel's B'day I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-) Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like Or Jian (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert. The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha. Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends! Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea... Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too. But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain. I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe"
350,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"10,October,2002","My Mobile Phone...Literally (Part 2) I walked slowly towards the tram stop... all the while feeling sad, and praying. 'Oh Lord...help!' Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. Waitaminit! Wait a minute! Before I left the lecture hall, I threw a plastic bag into the bin. Now it had made an unusually loud 'thunk' when it landed, which was why I picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin. But I didn't see anything, so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when I threw the plastic bag in. That 'thunk' could've been my phone! As I recall, I was holding my phone in my right hand - I must have let it go along with the plastic bag! Excitement bubbled up inside me. I ran for the security station again, praying in tongues all the while. Panting and out of breath, I knocked on the window. 'Angelo! I..gasp..think...gasp...it could be in..gasp...hold on, I'm gasping too much...' I explained my theory, and he just laughed good-naturedly. 'Sarah! You're killing us!' He called Keith again, and I ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre. We walked back in anticipation, as I apologised to Keith for making him walk back there again. I was telling God, 'if I can find it, I'm just gonna say 'Thank You Jesus!' and use this as testimony man! I was so sure... We reached the theatre, and I ran for the bin. Pushing my sleeves up, I dug into the bin, which housed a few coffee cups, my KFC plastic bag, and used tissues. No phone. But I knew I heard a 'thunk'! So I shifted the bin aside, and lo-and-behold, it was there!! Neatly resting against the wall, undamaged. WOOPADEEDOOO PRAISE GOD!! I jumped up and down in excitement, and even grabbed Keith's arm, shouting 'Thank You, thank you!' He smiled, and said, 'That's ok, as long as you don't make me come back here again!' I grinned back. We walked out, and I kept thanking God. I suddenly remembered that I had promised to proclaim Jesus' name in this situation, and I'd forgotten to. Suddenly I felt nervous about it saying it out loud. I whispered loudly 'Thank you Jesus.' - don't know if Keith heard. I realised I was being a chicken about it, so as we were walking I said, 'Wow, that's amazing, I really thought I'd lost my phone!' Keith turned and nodded. 'Yeah, it's really a MIRACLE that I found it, I mean, most people never find their phones! I really THANK GOD man. It's just so amazing. AMEN, amen!', I said, stressing on the erm...Christian-sounding words... As we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark, I looked up at the sky, and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me. The trees, the damp ground, the cold air. I raised my hands a lil', and whispered 'Thank You Lord.' EPILOGUE I walked back towards the guard station with Keith. Before he left, I said thank you agian, and asked for his name, giving him mine as well - just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus. I walked up towards the guard window and waved at Angelo through the glass, holding my phone up for him to see. He smiled. (Praise God btw, that the bunch of us were the last few to leave - that way I knew who was locking up, and so could locate Angelo at the guard station.) I boarded the tram, and thanked God once again for his blessings. I bumped into another friend on the tram, and shared my testimony with her . Our God's really an awesome God!"
351,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"09,October,2002","My Mobile Phone...literally I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to. Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty! 'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus. So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?' 'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...' 'Have you checked it?' 'No, not yet. Probably later.' We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either. 'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.' I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up. My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone! I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed' DUH, I knew that already. 'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!' He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.' I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed. I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!' 'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...' He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it. I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it. I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up. tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally"
352,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"08,October,2002","Why? Why is it that you can never repeat that fresh-from-salon look, even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair? My hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky. I don't know how the guy at the salon did it, with his creme and his scrunching fingers, but it looks weird now....sigh. Or maybe 'coz I'm trying to do it with bed-hair, and not freshly blown & washed hair. Whatever it is, I can't repeat the look. Sigh...sob. Why is it that even though your body is aching and tired, your mind is still awake so you just can't fall asleep? I spent the other night in an insomniac stage, and ended up watching informercials. I am actually seriously considering buying one of the products, Winsor Pilates from the website! Hmmm... Why is it that even though I have things to do, like essays and such, I can never fully concentrate on them? Instead I end up getting distracted by TV and the like. Oh there's the computer, oh, maybe I'm hungry...hmmm maybe I should go mend the hole in my t-shirt... Why is it that even though I have school later, and I haven't done my readings, and my stomach's rumbling 'coz I haven't had lunch, I'm still stuck here blogging, drawn like a moth to a flame?

354,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"01,October,2002","Highlights of the Day I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point. After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from 'wicked!' and 'gorgeous!' to 'don't go back to long hair in a hurry!' and 'eh, quite nice ah, hor?' Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws? Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked 'unreal' heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape. The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY! And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo! Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round... After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud. Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!"
355,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"01,October,2002","Yummers Had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt ice-cream. It's sitting in the freezer now, setting, and by tomorrow I should have a delightful dessert! Woopadeedoo! That said, tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work, 'coz I've an essay due on Monday. It's the Cont. Hollywood one, which I caught a lucky break - i.e turned out I had 2 extra weeks to do it. Eep. But have I spent the time wisely doing more research? No....Why? 'Coz I deserve a rest dammit! teeheehee... Oh yes, went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans. One was the Just Jeans one which I bought on Friday, the other a Sportsgirl one which I've been wearing a lil' sua-ku-ly , i.e. with the hem folded up a huge chunk. Did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day? I didn't! Thought I'd had to wait a couple of days 'coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do. Well, as I found out, JJ has an in-house seamstress who does it on the spot. Unfortunately, she wasn't in today, so I left it to be collected tomorrow. As for the Sportsgirl one, they send it out to be altered, to a place just across the road called Melbourne Central Tailoring. It was on the 1st Level of an office building, in a tiny little room at the corner. I almost thought I was on the wrong floor 'coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitor's office, with its tinted glass windows and couches. It was only after hearing voices from my left, and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that I found the place, run by this really nice n friendly couple. The lady was talking to a Jeans West salesgirl (I figured JW also sent their jeans to be altered there...she was holding a couple of bags), so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile. Real nice. And the price was right too! After calling several places earlier in the morning, I found out they were the cheapest, charging only $10 (yes, yes, please don't compare to Far East prices ok? If I were back home, I'd have gotten my grandma to do it for me for FREE - she was a seamstress after all). I'd have sent the Just Jeans pair to them too, except for the fact that JJ charges only $5.50 to do their own jeans, with a receipt of purchase of course. All in all, am quite excited to collect them tomorrow. Yippee-kai-yay!"

But her voice was beautiful, enchanting, ephemeral even, as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air, like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness. She was funny too. 'Is someone smoking pot in here?' 'Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well.' The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit. After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album 'Drive'), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are 'last song' performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore. Confession: I teared when she sang 'Drive' as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose. Sigh, whadda wuss I am... I think I might end up liking her first album more - will go take a listen and see if I'm right.

There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!! The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going 'Wooohooo!!'. A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you.

I was bugging him after dinner to 'be spontaneous' and to 'go somewhere', like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time. Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching. In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo? *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....) Thaaaaaaaaaaaaaat's right..."
360,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"21,November,2002","Music makes the people come together... How would I describe by taste in music? I say, eclectic. Or in other words, rojak . I never really listened to music, other than Christian Praise n Worship growing up, since I was living with parents who thought 'rock music is not edifying to your soul. Why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good?' Not quite 'rock music is from the devil', though pretty close. But it does make a lotta sense in retrospect I guess. After discovering that there was alternative Christian music (ie. same genres like rock, dance etc. but with Christian or more sanitised language), I was into that for awhile. Esp. since Jars of Clay was pretty cool. Then it was Bossa Nova, and all that Jazz. Now? I dunno. I listen to anything and everything. A bit of Killing Heidi, a little Diana Krall, some Foo Fighters, some John Mayer, a twist of Disco Montego, a dash of Bebel Gilberto and Jobim, some Cafe del Mar series. Like I said, it's pretty rojak. After a long time trying to figure out my music tastes, I realised I can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as I can in a mosh-pit (like this Sat. at the KH gig - phew, gonna get me some bruises). Woohooo! I shall not be typecast! I am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music! hur hur... Most underrated band? A New Zealand outfit called Eight , who came down to S'pore a couple years back. I met the guys, and they were really really nice, and funny too (although a couple of the ones I knew have left since). Their music's really different, so if you get a chance to check 'em out, it'll be great. I personally can't really describe the music, or put it in any category. I call it weird-but-definitely-listenable. They call it rock. And they're playing for Big Day Out in New Zealand next Jan too! kewl huh? Darn, too bad not in Oz, although NZ is a hop skip and jump away...hmmm...holiday? PS. Happy Birthday Kenneth!! 21 November 2002"

Favour Lord! Learned to clean the machines too. Next week, I'll be doing the busy morning periods - 7.30-9.30am, where the orders just keep pouring in. Hooooo....it'll be tough..."

I can honestly say I'm really enjoying myself. It's was really fun, and not too stressful, 'coz the Queensberry n Lt. Bourke store isn't as bz as the rest of the GJs outlets in town. In other news, my silly iron has broken down. Maybe the fact I'd dropped it accidentally from the ironing board has something to do with it. Maybe, just maybe. Whatever it is, it's gonna be hell to fix. Erp. My cough and slight flu is still going on. All the honey drinks and gargling with Listerine doesn't seem to help. Dangnabbit!"

I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one! It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh. So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before. I can only describe the feeling in one word: bleuuurghghhffffgg. I felt extremely bleuuurghghhffffgg. And the next coupla days promise to be worse. It's rollercoasting up and down, from 23 tomorrow, to 33 the day after, to 19 the day after that, to 23 on Thursday again.

It was nice and sunny at Mid Brighton Beach, but way too windy. Overall, it was fabulously delicious, I got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles - ie. very squishy n small. Oooh we went to Hunter Gatherer at Acland Street, St. Kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about $19. Kewl eh? Charles says it makes me look like Jungle Girl, ah but what da hey, you only turn 23 once. Sigh...23...soon it'll be 25, then 30. How life zooms past. Ever get the feeling? Anyways, for dinner, EG brought me to this v. nice restaurant by the bay/beach in Williamstown, called Anchorage Restaurant. I had the Sirloin, he had the Eye fillet, even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint. We ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu. By boy, delicious! And the company was good, although it strayed to topics like 'Is it possible to make drunken fries? Or like flambe it or something...', to which we started enacting how we'd do it, like (cup hands together) here's a potato, (jerk arm as if adding seasoning) add wine, followed by (flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette) lighting it, and then (move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom) TA DAAA!!!' 10 mins later.... EG: 'Hey, what are those?' Me: (Chewing a rather large piece of medium-rare steak...) Cup hands together, jerk arm as if adding seasoning, flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette, move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom EG: 'Potatoes?' Me: Excitedly pointing left index finger to nose, and right index finger to EG, nodding vigrously, cheeks full of food The highlight? EG: 'Eh? You don't want the mushroom ah?' Me: 'Mushroom? What mushroom?' EG: 'Er...that.' Me: 'It's a mushroom? Oh my goodness! I thought it was a really burnt slice of potato! Like, flambe-d or something!' Yes, my blonde roots were showing. My parents called later, to wish me a Happy Birthday, as well as my sis this morning. Tho Thweet. And Bart too, half and hour ago (Note to Bart: It's OK!! I still love you! :-) ) How does it feel to turn 23? I really don't know. Ask me again the same day next year."

So far I've gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly iBook from EG, Charles and Wally, and very adorable Sabi underwear from Bel. It's blue striped with a goldfish in front - she was very excited about it hehe. (Although Charles insists it isn't a goldfish, it's just a fish that's orange-gold in colour. Looking at it, yeah, maybe, but me and Bel will insist it is a goldfish! For my (name)sake!) We're going for a picnic at Brighton Beach later, and a nice dinner, just me n EG later tonight. Can't wait. How we decided on Brighton Beach was really amazing! We were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic. So I thot, hmm, somwhere not too far out, but still away from the city. Maybe a beach, or the countryside. Figured, hey, we've passed Brighton beach a coupla times on our way to Ikea in Moorabin, why not give it a go? I still wasn't sure though... Then EG came home, so I asked him, 'Where should we go?' 'How about Brighton Beach?' I stared at him, while scrambling to find in my brain whether i'd mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something. Nope-didn't. 'You're kidding! I thot of it too! Oh my gosh!' 'Yeah, Shawn's been there once, siad it was pretty good.' 'Oh my gosh! It's a sign I tell you! I even asked Evie about it just now. Maybe God wants us to be there or something...heheh' Hmm..maybe he does? We'll see. It's amazing how excited I get about the lil' things in life...very easily amused hehe... Okely dokelies.

'Oh, Singapore isn't very big, it's actually smaller than Victoria...we don't really have states.' Yes, yes, such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting. I really hope people didn't leave thinking 'god, that weird Chinese girl talks waaaay too much'. 'Coz that's what I think I did. Left people with bits of information that they didn't really want to know. Sigh. On the up side, I think overall it went pretty well. The other staff pple were nice, and so was the meal, at Kun Ming Restaurant at Lt. Bourke St. It's been there for ages apparently, and got a huge do-up recently, leaving it looking pretty posh. Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk. I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess. But I have a good vibe about the job...the boss, the pple, the place, the uniforms (which me Boss has to re-order 'coz they were a lil' too big). They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....) Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues!

Just returned from the movie - it wasn't too bad, albeit a lil' predictable towards the end. Does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book? Kenneth believes its different - shan't say more or I'll be accused of being a 'spoiler'. Anyways, just thot some areas could be developed more, like the relationship between Reba and Francis (aka Mr D. aka Red Dragon aka Psychotically Repressed And Emotionally Abused Serial Killer). Stellar performance from Mr. Hopkins . Wasn't much space for Edward Norton to strut his stuff though. Same goes for Ray Fiennes. Emily Watson was very convincing as Reba, the blinking kewpie doll. That aside, I also went to Borders and almost bought a book - 'White Teeth' by Zadie Smith (was it Smith?), although was stopped at the last minute by Shawn who said it sucked. He said he was willing to give me his copy, which was back in Singapore though. Damn... I spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading the Glamour mag that I'd started the last time I was at Borders. At $11 a pop, I don't have the moola to spend on buying imported mags, so it's Border's free browsing for me. Never got to the last page, but did read an interesting article by Kristen Gore Schiff (Al and Tipper's daughter btw) regarding women, work and motherhood, and why can't women have it all without compromise. I'll prob. read it again, to relook at the fine points she brought up. Did you know that Australia and America are the only two developed countries which have UNPAID maternity leave? tsk tsk....UK has 18 days while Hungary has 24! A couple months back there was a huge hoo-haa regarding a bill that a women's coalition was trying to pass, that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave. Some said it wasn't economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned. Me? I'm not quite sure where my stand is, 'coz I don't enough about the properties of the bill, nor do I know how much maternity is enough, nor do I know what the so-called economic costs are. So, gotta find out so I can weigh out the costs, and see where I stand. I do believe, however, that the company she works for should be supportive, and allow her enough time to spend with her child, and not penalise her in monetary terms. In short, motherhood/household maintenance etc. is work! I wonder if anyone's written a thesis about the whole leave-the-nursing-to-the-maids issue in Asia. How does that affect a woman's stand and her power relations with men and other women? Other than the gender issue, it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too. Any thots? Leave a bl00p!"

After years of thinking such people as le poseur , I've come to the conclusion that we can't help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly. I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta. Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode. Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing? Yep, we sure do. Oh, how much does it cah-st? Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America. Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent. Uh, yeah, I am. Oh, which part? Sawrry? I mean where are you from? Erm, America?

Added to that I'd injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey. Sigh - the injuries from my go-karting expedition happened b4 the race'd even started! But going at pedel-to-the-metal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience. Some people call it a speed rush; me, I call it time to pray. I think it was scary 'coz the turns came up too soon - didn't get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding.

Oh and the mandatory shag scene, I'd like to think, was thrown in for good measure just to prove a) he digs Britney Murphy's character, Alex, b) to show how trite and meaningless sex is today, and c) just to please the bulk of the movie's audience made up of adolescents wanting to Be Like Em, who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh, esp. Murphy's (although let's not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lily-white ass to the audience as part of the Rap Battle Royale sequence at the end). That said, with those intense close-ups of Emmy's face, I think he's actually kinda cute. Symmetrical features, piercing blue eyes. In fact, he could down right be a nice sweet ol' guy.

'Coz he was sweet enough to drive me all the way to Ardeer, which is majorly far away (although taking the M1 and West Gate Fwy cut the driving time considerably). It was past Sunshine. If I were to travel by bus, it'd have taken me forever - just think of travelling from Pasir Ris to Jurong and back, and there's only ONE bus that goes that way. And why was I doing in Ardeer (formerly known as Deer Park West) anyways? 'Coz I was there to pick up my mobile phone, which had accidentally slipped out of my bag in the bus that morning, and ended up in the hands of a lil' ol' lady who didn't even know what it was! She popped it into her bag, and when she finally picked up the phone after I'd rung it countless times upon discovering its disappearance, I was overcome with joy. Praise God. What a miracle. Considering the fact that she had no idea how to operate a mobile phone. After a long while trying to figure out where she lived (her English wasn't very good - I think she's Italian), and after calling Charles countless times, and after rearranging my meeting with Bridget, I was finally off to Ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my blood-line, my mobile phone. Where all my contacts (and the free pass-SMS to 'Chicago') were stored. Mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me, to which I gave her an impulsive hug, so relieved I was. Phew. That's almost-losing my phone twice within a few months. I really have to get into the habit of looking behind me before I leave. Bugger."

'Coz Sprint Driving School's instructor really sucks in the personality department. He was this guy in his 30s, gruff, with curly hair, Nike sunglasses and Bunker shoes.

Was planning to do so, until he quoted me a slightly higher price - $27 for 45 mins, compared to Sprint's $25.

This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).* Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose. There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett. The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess. 'Hey!' I said when I felt the push. 'Stupid fucking chink' he said at the same time, as he walked on. I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, 'What an asshole!' Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back 'Hey what's the matter with you?' The Pudge turned around. 'She didn't move outta the way.' 'And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man' Shawn replied before turning around. The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than 'you wanna piece o' me', and more cheesy than 'bring it on'. Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of 'Settle!!' while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end. Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating 'So what?' 'Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?' I said. I was ignored. There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers. And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)? Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed 'Ow' she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter 'Bitch' UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it. So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful 'thank you for being so niiiice', and 'God loves you' (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of 'whatever'. And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men). As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, 'hey we can do this right now, man. Come on...' The Pudge just fudged his battle. Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to 'ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that' We smiled, 'yeah, that's good to know. Thanks'. They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile. It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a Woman of Asian descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe] If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today. Try calling her a stupid effin' chink. 5 January 2003"

We had games - a group skits, CNY karaoke competition, and of course, a Lion Dance! Oh man, spent the whole night before sticking and layering the crepe paper onto cardboard boxes. Darn...what a waste. If I had server space, I'd upload some photos so u guys can check out...but unfortunately...ah wells. But trust me, we had a lot of fun, and lots to eat, and everyone pretty much seemed to enjoy themselves, and we also had sparklers too! And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh? A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying 'I'm not Asian!' under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled. I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults. I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.

Woohooo! I called me mum yesterday to talk, and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers' future. Seems like the older one's acting up again, understandable seeing how he's going through the teenage angst years, but he's more difficult than she's imagined it to be, and she's worried over the company he's been mixing with, who've recently been caught shoplifting. Stealing for the Winona Ryder-esque thrill of it. And we're talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here. Bored rich kids who don't understand the value of money, who bandy about their fathers' wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys, sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them, like my brother. Maybe I'm being judgemental here, but I honestly don't care, just wish my bro would wise up. Sigh, the financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone. I'm hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses, at least till I graduate. I missed the boat on the rent one, which subsidises about $60 a week, but hopefully there are others I can apply for. It's no-strings-attached, so prayerfully, that'll work out somewhat, to alleviate the financial burden on my parents. It's quite pathetic how I keep running to God only when I'm in trouble or worried, however understandle it is, being a part of human nature. Yet sometimes I wish I could find the passion I once had about church and reading his Word, yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that I can't find a reason to, or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my Bible to read and meditate. Although I see myself reaching out some way, in my little human form, for that vast expanse that is 'spirituality' and 'passion for God' yet coming up short most times. Is it the engagement of the topic however? Does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate? We (and I say we in the broadest sense 'coz I think most of us tune out once in awhile) learn when we're receptive and humour creates such an environment. How much then, do we learn when we switch off or don't connect with the speaker sometimes? But beside the Sunday agenda, there's more work to do to, on a daily basis, building such a close relationship, which to be honest, makes me wish I could have a proper conversation with God - as in hear audibly and see physically. Are real relationships based on this? The seeing and hearing and touching and feeling? The tangibility of the other? Ah wells...back to my little worm hole I guess..."

I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing 'I Spy with my Little Eye' as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out 'No Pa! It's the TV lah!' I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me.

Pastor Gan from Malaysia shared that some years back, he offered his home to shelter a village girl from Ipoh, who was an orphan. One day, she had some food particles stuck between her teeth and asked this pastor friend of mine what to do. Pastor Gan offered her a string of dental floss and taught her how to do it. She went into the bathroom and didn't come out till quite some time. Pastor then asked her did she floss out the food particle and she said yes. Then, handed the dental floss string back to Pastor and said 'I washed it many times already. Return to you.' hahahhahaha...some ulu kampong girl.... Mummy....

Tuesdays are those for me, often times 'coz the Exec. team meetings are long and arduous, and whatever little I contribute seem of even lesser importance. But that's just today. Most times, it's pretty all right, it's just that being surrounded by thinkers and visionaries and perpetuators of God's kingdom is pretty intimidating. Plus the fact that it starts at 8.30 in the morning and coupled with the sore lack of sleep the previous night for goodness-knows-what reason. Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake. To be honest, the sore lack of sitting down and meditating on his Word and doing my devotions is probably a key cause of this. Need discipline!! Ah wells, just a bit of a whinge s'all."

It throws up a lot of issues to do with the convergence of religion with mainstream pop culture, and the harkening of 'being the salt and light of the world' - to influence (rather than be influenced). In this case, who's influencing whom? Mass media or Christianity? Are we merely using whatever means necessary to reach today's jaded youth? To 'reclaim' popular culture? Or has popular culture claimed us? Is usurping pop culture a means to an end? But to what extent? Has it become a turn-off? Jesus can be cool, and he sure can be radical. But so what? Any thoughts?"
442,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"31,December,2003","I feel it in my fingers...I feel it in my toes... So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of 'Love Actually'. And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch! The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances). Truth be told, the movie should really be titled 'Lust Actually', or 'Luff Actually'. It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love - choosing to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the 'sweet pure agony of being in love'. One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as (can you believe it?) the British Prime Minister!! Like i said, it was hilarious! (Although I must say, Mr Four-Weddings-and-a-Funeral can still charm the ladies with his foppish yet debonair ways...) Look out for the cameos!"
443,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"29,December,2003","Ponder I've just finished a book by Francine Rivers called 'And the Shofar Blew'. It's a very real, telling, tale of the lives lead by a Pastor and his wife, called to serve a local community when the church's pastor retires. The book weaves intricately, and into depth, of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry, into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad, the respected leader of a well-known mega-church. It's not a plot-driven book. The climax is almost predictable, and the pace tends to dawdle at times. But the attention to emotional detail is amazing, and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do, while facing their daily demons. I expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment, of longing, that the journey I'd begun had ended all too shortly. But surprisingly, it left me cold. A cool splash to wake me up, to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry, of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel. Are we building projects too fast, steamrolling whatever (or whoever) gets in the way of progress? Am I constantly listening to the Spirit's guidance? Is this what the Lord wants? These questions were whirring through my head as I finished the last chapter. And I have no answers. Not yet anyways. And I'm glad for reading that book - not just due to its entertainment factor - but for the fact that it got me thinking. And to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry, my calling (which may throw doubts in the face of faith - always an unpopular approach). To think of what I'm doing, and how it ties in with the Purpose of My life, and to think about why I choose to do what I do; why I work on the projects I do right now; whether I'm going along with the flow 'coz it's my job; do I truly believe what I say I should believe in for 2004? Questions questions questions. It's good, I think. At least I'm thinking, and not following along like a blind herded sheep. The answers, I believe, lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my Self - the Self that's lazy, unmotivated, procrastinating, happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me. And I know that's not how life should be; rolling with the punches, drifting from pleasure to pain and back again. There's more! Wake up Sparky!!"

Have gotten good reviews so far, and it's even inspired a cabaret-style performance idea, with life-sized props to illustrate the story, with Ellen (Philpott) and assorted backup singers/dancers in shiny costumes bobbing up and down, holding top hats and canes! Very showy, but what would you expect from a song to the tune of Copacabana?! Imagine...a darkened theatre, a solitary spotlight focussed onstage, where a lone figure sits on a barstool, her head bowed down, capped by a black fedora. The tune plays over the sound system, and on cue, I pop my head up and start singing, softly at first, then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me, while the dancers carry the life-sized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and..and...and... Phew!! Gotta get my head outta the clouds...."

So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with. Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to NOT work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn exams just get in the way!! Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me. I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in 'teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime', that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.) As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!! Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!"

Tonight was spent, quite lovely in fact, in the presence of like individuals who enjoy the oftentimes eccentric humour shared intrinsically. Yes, we're all kooks. That's why our bunch's called 'Out of the Box'. That aside, it was pretty fun to revisit the Veggietales 'King George and the Ducky',not least Larry's silly song on Barbara Manatee. BUt mostly, it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our song-and-dance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner. In the words of Bob the Tomato, 'have we got a show for you!!' Suffice to say, we're ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it. They're songs that kids would appreciate I presume, not least for the fact they're composed by a bunch of adults with very kid-like mentalities. I can imagine the spiel: 'Bible characters come to life in this charming stage rendition of stories like you've never heard them before!' Cue spotlight as the cast emerges. I'm lovin' it!"

Surprisingly though, today was still pretty warm. I guess 'coz it's only the 9th day of winter. Which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an Intern at ACCF!! (applause applause) Today's BIG QUESTION: What does it mean to live a life that's adventurously expectant ? Romans 8:15 [MSG]: The resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike, 'what's next, Papa'? I guess for me, a life that's lived adventurously is one that's on the edge (however cliche that sounds!), built in faith. Expectancy calls for faith, calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities. Adventurously - that's a call to be daring, to leave our comfort zones. So today, I shall begin like this: I adventurously expect... Post your adventurous expectancies, people! (in the comments section)"

It's like playing word association, where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses. These are the words for me: Aunty Yvonne CNY Angpow Chicken Wings Wedding Funeral Life Support Heart Lung Breath Cancer Crash Distant Close Love Home Tim Danny Adeline Daisy Telok Blangah Short hair Maternal Peace Heaven Love I wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations, stop-gaps to create a sense of connection, like I'm grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers. I don't know what to feel, and I'd gather most in my situation wouldn't as well. Sad, yes but yet, at times, not really. It's only when triggers appear, or when I'm not distracted by something else, work, people, church. Like I'm trying every emotion in the spectrum for size, to see how it fits. Do I grieve? Yes I guess, where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably, but not very long each time, and anyways, just what are the rules for the mourning process? So new, this is. So very new. I wonder if my Grandma realises what's happened. And I wonder what that would trigger in her too - will she babble and smile, and greet familiar faces at the wake, not comprehending its significance? Or worse, understand the full painful measure of the loss of a child? Too many thoughts to ponder..."

We're going to be Equipped in tools, teaching, and the bonds of friendship, this Weekend, to carry us through the tide and turmoil of an everchanging world. I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial. She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now... I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a 'she might be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family. We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully. Uncomprehendingly."

After the high from learning and utilising my brain at the Rikk Watts seminar over the last couple of days, coupled with the social performance of maintaining friendships over a meal, I'm suddenly feeling really, really, for lack of a better word, sian . I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job. And there's the praying meeting in an hour-and-a-half's time, which I don't feel like going to, yet don't wish to spend my night distracting myself with the meaningless void of watching TV or a movie. It's a waste of time, which I've always known, yet can't seem to tear myself from. Hence I've to put my foot down on that one right now. Which is why I'm going for the meeting. Altho' of course, a huge part is so I won't disappoint the people who expect me to be there - BUT! If that element serves to stop me from distracting myself with other meaningless objects, then so be it. ARGH. The groans and pains of a growing Christian living in the POST-post-modern world.

472,649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"12,July,2004","Grandma I was suddenly reminded of my grandma. Of the fraility of life. Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision? I wrote this in response, to that reminder: 'I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned. But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist.' To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength. He is. And will be."

Yeah it does to me too. But catchy title aside, it's pointing out that nutritional dieting may not neccesarily mean a deprivation of all luscious food, great and holy. From the glimpses I've had, it's pointing out how moderation is key, understanding how your body works, and maintaining a healthy relationship with food to ensure quality life over YEARS. So that means a good balanced meal of protein, veggies, and YES! CARBS and FAT even! HAH! Take that, consumer marketing....No fads.

474,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","Every morning when I wake up I think, 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!' I hate getting up in the morning. I am so not a morning person that I am the anti-morning person. If you talk to me as I am waking, I will growl at you, even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me. I crave Saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on. But, somehow, and micraculously, after about 15-20 minutes on the weekdays, I begin to perk up, start making the coffee (thank God for coffee) and think that maybe I can make it through the day without vertically snoring. I do end up making it through the day, but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon. The hours between 4-6 have become my nemisis. The problem revolves around the fact that I stay up 'til about 12:30 or 1 everynight (I teach school so this is way late). There is no real reason why I do this. I am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater. No, you can usually catch me doing, well, nothing I guess. I can't acurately say what I do each night. Sometimes I'm reading, sometimes watching TV, sometimes reading blogs online, and sometimes talking to west coast friends. I used to actually stay up to watch Letterman, but TV bores me more and more lately. I have always been a night owl. I can't remember when I didn't like staying up late. It must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when I can remember watching Saturday Night Live and Johnny Carson with my family (I know, quality bonding time). I remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and I was convinced this would improve my grades. I still 'wake up' at about 8pm everynight. This is when I begin getting things done, the dishes, the laundry, the phone calls, the emails, the projects, the organizing. About 2 hours into my second wind, I remember that I wanted to go to bed early so I don't feel like shit in the morning, but 10pm rolls around and I think I can give it one more hour and then I think if I go to bed at midnight I'll still get about 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep. Sounds good, but this never happens. So, everynight I stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon. I wish that I could say that I have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties, but no. That's not me anyway. Instead, I'll be washing my hair, helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book. Tonight I will be, um, let's see, um, well, how about reading my fabulous travel book on London (no, I'm not going anytime soon, I'm just obsessed) until midnight. And tomorrow morning when I wake up I will think 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'"

I mean, is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build? Think, architects, think! My neighbors downstairs are college students. Why they live in our beautiful, mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals, far away from the college they attend apartment complex, I don't know. And, I actually, don't know them. I know that one is a boy and one is a girl. I know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along, mostly Dave Matthews songs. I know the girl will occasionally put on some Jason Mraz. (My connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds, but I will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know.) And, I know that I can hear the boy cough at times. What does that mean he can hear me do? I wonder about this one. Tonight, they are listening to the radio and they have what I think is a subwoofer cranked up so as I sit here trying to watch TV or listen to my music, I just hear deep voices and bass. It BLOWS!!!!!!!!! So, being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor, I turned up my subwoofer to the MAXIMUM. Take that you slackers! I am usually quite kind with my subwoofer. When my brother installed it and put it at Maximum, I told him I had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower, a lot lower. So much for thinking of other people. The reason for this retaliation is that I think that they like to bang their ceiling, my floor, when they think that I am being loud. I am not loud. OK, so I always have some kind of noise on, I hate quiet, but when I am watching TV and they bang, and I check the volume, it is on 2 bars. 'OK people, I pay enough in rent to listen to my TV at 2 FUCKING BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' I am not actually sure what the banging is about. I wonder sometimes if it is my imagination. What could 2-3 pounding-like sounds in rapid succession be? One day I came home and as I walked in the door I heard the 2 bangs. I threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor 'I haven't even been here to make noise. What, you don't like it when I open my door?' Maybe, just maybe, there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while I am constantly monitoring my volume. I can't help but remember the Friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise. When he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them, but they are all in his apartment. Could this be what is happening in my building? I don't know, but I always turn down the noise if I hear the banging until, of course, tonight and the subwoofer wars. Game on!"

He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of 'She Bangs' was almost worth the $20 admission fee. 2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps. I know, you're jealous again. Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements. 3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended. We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on. Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks. 4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door. There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door. Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing. Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um. When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says 'I'm sorry, I just really had to pee,' say 'It's OK, do what you gotta do' and quickly get in your car and pull away. Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad."

I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May. As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.' Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life. I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small. Since college, they just keep on coming. Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s. Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home. I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway. This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people). That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator). I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway. This is all about me. I mean, it's always about me anyway, right? This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me. These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor. When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone. Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent. One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.' I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway. So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need. I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come. But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no. I've already rescued myself. I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet. No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him. I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have. I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones."

But then, there in the distance, on the hour, every hour, and during rush hour and some good hours on Friday night and Sunday, there is NPR to rescue me. I like a pop song just as much as the next person, but I don't think that I ever actually will 'find [you] in a club with a bottle full of bub,' but I do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies. (I heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day.) I love the idea of multitasking, driving and getting abreast of what is, or is not, going on in the world. I can't watch news on TV anymore, unless it's BBC and then only when I'm actually in England, because the inane (trying to be) analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these people's mouths is too much for me to stand. I tell my father everytime that I am home that FoxNews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience (if you didn't know, that's suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing, 8th grade, yeah I know). He just ignores me and continues to be 'dumbed down.' Newspapers are fine, but I don't have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesn't seem right to me. And so, when I get in my car and I'm just sick of hearing the same 4 songs, I check the clock and thank God that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as I drive home. Some days, I even leave early in the morning so that I can hear the more in-depth news as I drive in (the closer you get to 9am the more 'entertaining' the pieces get). I mean, all things considered I just need a little fresh air to handle this American life."
479,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?' As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong. This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended. I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.' And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism. Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.' My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school. And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree. A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal. It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism. (My mom is older than my friends' parents. She has a 39 year-old son after all.) I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind. It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years. But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had. Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions? What if we just want to be married and have children? And that's it. What if we want it that simple? Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway? I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker. But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future. After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class."
480,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","When riding my bike and a slight hill appears I must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline (I'm not talking real hills). As I'm peddaling with more and more emphasis I can't help but be aware of my powerhouse legs. My calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight. There are two reasons for my treetrunk legs. First, there is genetics (I know, blame your mother). But seriously, I've never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat, sure there is the occasional walking of the dog, but no intense exercise going on, and yet these women do not have dainty legs. We have legs built for... well I don't know what for. The second reason is Linda Watkins School of Dance. I was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs, how else could they leap like that? I tapped, balleted, toed, and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes, plies, and time steps. I usually hated dance class, but the recitals I lived for. There is nothing like being on stage and performing. My favorite was the kick line. And still, years later, when I hear Elvis Costellos' 'Hot Hot Hot' (which is not that often) I want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split, oh there were splits. Sadly, I couldn't do a split now if you paid me. I miss the way a dancer knows her body, how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated, even walking can be a dance. Our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancer's grace. The story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand. When she stepped up her back stairs to her house, she slipped on a thin layer of ice. And this is where the grace comes in- she would emphasize that because she was dancer, she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground, legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow. The strange thing is that I don't remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class, but I understood what she was saying. A dancer's right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing. I've never broken a bone, pulled a muscle, or torn a ligament, could this be due to the dancing? I don't know but, thanks to Linda Watkins, when I'm 85 and fall down my front stairs, I may not in fact break my hip."

OK, so I would like to own a house here, but my kids would go to public school, damnit. On my bike tour past the beautiful AgeCroft (yes, some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from England, but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves). The house is amazing and has a prescious spot in Richmond, it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments. It's serene, and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home, C-ville. Growing up among moutains, I hated them. My hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below. And, in many ways they did, my hometown is a sheltered place. Though quaint at times, it could possibly be the redneck version of 'A City Upon (surrounded by) A Hill (hills).' But, we all know what happens to Utopia, oh yeah, it doesn't exist. So, for most of my life I have cursed the moutains and hills, especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift (I actaully gave up trying for a good year). I didn't start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in Montana. I traveled to Montana for a friends wedding and when I stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains I thought I was back in my hometown except there are no semi-tall buildings and I don't think they know what urban sprawl is. Throughout the weekend I kept thinking, 'What is so great about these moutains?' OK, so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than Virginia's and they are bit more pristine, but really, no Virginian would be that amazed as I wasn't. Then when drving back to C-ville from the airport in DC and going up and down the rolling hills, I thought 'These are my hills, Montana has nothing on these.' I think I began to love my state then. I'm proud to be a Virginian which is saying something, considering I have always wished to be an North Carolinian. Richmond has no hills or mountains to look at, we're too far east. I actually miss them. Some days as I'm driving to work I feel like I don't have everything that I need for the day, I check everything, my watch, my purse, my coffee and I and can't find the missing piece, but maybe it's the moutains, the Blue Ridge, that I'm missing, without really knowing it."
482,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house. The pillow said, in green thread, 'Bloom Where You're Planted' and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words. The first time I saw this pillow, I thought 'What a great saying.' After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight. The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted. The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days. I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time. Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy. The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning. I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere. Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen. And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate. And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form. Next Time Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein. ~Naomi Shihab Nye"
483,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I love the bridges of Richmond. They are no architectural triumphs by any means. They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying. My favorite is the Nickel bridge. It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work. It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think. As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other. The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me. On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation. The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top. Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous. Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance. Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge. On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks. The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond. When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level. The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil. The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St. It extends into the posh westend of Richmond. This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping. But, it's length is what is so fascinating. It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all. When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees. Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest. As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river. It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected. The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description. The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights. The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite. It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the 'projects,' a sad and large part of this troubled town. This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing. Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath. The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James. The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia. It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall. I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do. Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge. The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above. It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge."

I'm a teacher for children with special needs in public schools. I used to teach children with Autism which was fascinating. For a long time, Autism was my passion. At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again. I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me. It's a complicated, long story. I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me. I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it. What does it mean to love a job? What does it mean to love anything? I just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings. Things about me: when 'Sex and the City' ended I felt like my best friends moved away. I love my nieces and nephew. I love to read pop fiction (yes, Bridget Jones is a friend of mine). I have TiVo. I used to write poetry (fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names). I have a very well decorated apartment, it's beautiful if I do say so myself. I love to cook and don't do it enough. I need to learn to exercise frequently. I wish that I could: take amazing photographs, publish some poems/ book/ picture/ dna, travel to any city anytime, live in NYC, live in London, etc."
485,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","Do you remember watching music videos? I mean really watching them, like for hours. My brother and I, along with some neighborhood kids at times, would sneak snippets of MTV. We were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it, our parents not as quick as they were prudish. I was enamored with George Michael. Funny, he never seemed gay to me at age 10, but then again I didn't know what gay was then either. He was the perfection of hotness to me and that song, Careless Whisper, where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble, whew that stubble. These days, he's not so hot and I wonder why I never saw the obvious 'batting for the other team' going on, but again, this was the 80s, I don’t think he was letting many people in on his secrets, lest he lose album sales. A few months ago I was flipping through the channels and found FUSE, a music video channel here in Richmond where all they do is play videos. I was stunned. Some flashy hip-hop song was on and I paused, filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video. I felt like I was 12 again, the volume turned down, the den door closed, and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in. I haven't watched another video since that FUSE moment months ago. I miss the old videos where the stories were weak, if anything, the bands were overly made up, and the women had clothes on. The current generation has no idea what endless, mindless hours of music videos are like. They think MTV was created to expose the unreality of 18-23 lives. The teeny boppers today won't have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear. They're lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab TRL. And, what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists? The one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos. Remember Divo and the whips? My brother's band made a video a few years ago. And if you blinked you missed it. It did nothing for them because kids don't watch videos anymore, they want the (non) reality shows or the watered down, over-produced, uncreative pop star in their mist, and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day. Or at least, this is what MTV thinks they want. MTV has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking. And VH1, don't even let me go there. And it's sad to realize that I am no longer the target audience of MTV. They don't care about my demographic anymore, even though I busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood. Sorry Dire Straits, you can have your money for nothin'. It turns out I don't want my MTV."

Then pointed to me and said, 'You're the dirty rascal.' And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH. I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song. Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air. I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck. Whew! How long has it been since I've seen on one of those. Oh, the days of yore. *sigh*"

488,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I'm funny. Ask my friends; they'll tell you I'm funny. It's my thing, my party trick. I come from a long line of funny people. No, none of them are famous. We're funny the way your family is funny. The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air. My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science. It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast you’re not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do. And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other. Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for 'happy hour' I was anything but happy. Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me. I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain. I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done. There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much. My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground. There were some hits, but mostly misses. When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really. But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references. There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head. I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed. It was Raphael. I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist. A co-worker said, 'Is it a religious thing?' 'Um,' I thought, 'I give up.' Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class. I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU. He didn’t bowl over with laughter. 'What’s wrong with you?' I thought and then realized I don't really know these people. Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate. My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month. They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss. She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley. Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right. I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation."
489,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I went to Carytown today with my brother's little family. My 6 year-old nephew's artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there, part of a city-wide school art project. He was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see. It was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow. There was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom. One blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside. To the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an American flag in it, just hanging out. I asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged. His grandmother said it was a house and then I asked 'Well, is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house?' He said he just thought it up. 'All right, well, good picture little boy.' I then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artiste's mom states that the two buildings are 'Our house and Annie’s apartment building.' I turned my body and swung my head around, 'What, my apartment building?' To which the little one said 'Yeah' in his sweet, Well-what-else-could-it-be-? voice. I looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors. It was clearly a small one-story house sitting beside a 3-story brick apartment building. How did I not see it before? I said, 'Well, look at that, I'm famous.' And then the love swept over me. When a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture, that is love, real love. Thank you my little A baby. I love you too."
490,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I believe that dog-earing pages in a book is sac-religious. I think I may have engaged in this practice when I was 12 for a day or two, but it never stuck. It seemed too finite a thing to do. Reading a book is a fluid thing. Though you stop, put it down, go on about your life and come back to it, the story is fluid, or should be. So, to me, dog-earing the pages is like telling the pages, even the words to stop going, stop moving because the crease is always there. It stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene, stopped the monologue, or took a break between chapters. It will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dog-eared indentation. For me, the damage is permanent. Literal and literary disrespect has occurred, something a book can never shake off. So I use anything I can get my hands on to save my places. I have bookmarks, but they never seem to find their way into the books. In bookstore checkout lines I see pretty little bookmarks with clichéd phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate. But my Pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because I know that the $3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one. There is no real reason for this. When I need to hold my place I franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading. Beside my bed there are a number of books 'held' by varying objects. The most frequently read book has my glasses holding court, the short story book that I dip in and out of is splayed, open side down on a table, a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book light™, a travel book on London is held in place with the thin, red, satin ribbon attached to it, and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside. The receipt is my favorite placeholder. I think this is partly sentimental in that every time I open the book I look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase. Partly I'm sure I do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the $10.95 I spent on the paperback edition. And partly because it's convenient and perfect. A receipt takes up no space between the pages, it doesn't ask you to clip it on, it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark. It's the answer to the damaging dog-ear. It's the lazy woman’s pause button. It's quite possibly the very best un-bookmark. Yesterday I was digging through my assortment of not-yet-read books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside Carson McCullers' THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER. I'm sure at the time, my former therapist's business/ appointment card was the closest thing around when I stopped reading. I can't imagine that I just randomly put this card in this book. It was slipped between pages 4 and 5. A bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that I never really began reading it. Maybe I went for a teaser from the first couple of pages. I have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 20-50 pages into it, I pick up another book (see the bedside assortment listed above). This is one of my worst habits and one I really hate. Commitment phobia rears it's ugly head in some many places in my life. I just can't help but think there is a small, or rather quite large, message in THAT card in THAT book. Sometimes I wonder..."
491,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now. The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350º box. The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil. It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering. My father gave me this container which describes its contents as 'The World’s Best Chicken Rub.' He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of. I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here. I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where. The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside. Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family. I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out. The seasoning is described as a 'rub' and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken. In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice. A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus. I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter. I have made none so far. The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night. I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job. I've never cooked a ham before. Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them. The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said 'brown sugar and mustard.' 'OK,' I thought 'but how the hell much of either one?' I couldn’t ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of 'Have you learned nothing from me?' in her voice. I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge. I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred. The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham. Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture. The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try. My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away. I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week. I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory. The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week. I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks. I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once. (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your 'whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.') Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge. I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon. In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my 'sisters.' One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals. We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins. We thought our moms would be proud. We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low. During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice. I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with. A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes. There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing. But, right now my dinner's calling me."
492,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","Miraculously my blessed computer is now typing. I have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters 'HJKL andM' into '1234 and 5.' I took it to school today and I think maybe my baby didn't like being away from home. I wasn't that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and I expect that everyday may be it's last day. I have an order to send it in to Apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs. This makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health. But, I know I can’t do that. So I'll have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures. This is not that hard, just dump it on a disc, but I have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing. What should take me about 2-3 hours will probably take me 2-3 days. I'm just sentimental like that. My laptop is my baby. In fact, that's its name, My Baby. In the upper right hand corner of my Macintosh G4 Titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words 'My Baby' underneath. My laptop is one of my best friends. Not like 'Oh I can’t wait to go home and type on my computer.' But kinda. And no, I'm not a computer nerd. I use it for writing and Internet and well… music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so. It's like a best friend who enjoys a good flick, listens to my favorite tunes, and doesn't disagree with my neurotic banter, AND travels with me almost everywhere I go. This current computer is 2 years old, but is still fabulous. When I bought my G4, my older G3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that I was crazy to buy another one and asked which one I liked better. I stated that it was like choosing between two children, it was like Sophie's Choice, the Apple Macintosh version. If you like Macs then you LOVE them. There are few Mac people who could go either way, PC or Mac. I am quite obsessed with my Macs. I've had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with. They are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use machines. This is the first time I have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the Apple help line couldn't solve. This is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby. I'm scared, but today with the typing fiasco I came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing. Then I realized that my G3 was still available. I couldn't wait to get home and dig it out, to feel the tall, black keys under my fingers. Pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough. It makes writing fluid and effortless. I miss that keypad. When I opened the black chunky laptop I ran my hands over its edges. The design team at Apple gave the G3 PowerBook curves, like a woman. The edges are smooth and shapely; the sides of the computer make subtle 'S' shapes. It's high fashion, computer style. I miss the friendly rainbow Apple at the base of the screen. It goes to show that Apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow Apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes. Apple now goes for a sleek mono-colored, often white or grey, Apple, a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin. The rest of my G3 is simple and elegant. There are no extra buttons to 'go straight to the internet,' 'open you’re email,' or anything else that junks up a PC keyboard. There could be key functions that did those things for me of course, but I get to decide, Apple does not predetermine my preferences. I think the thing I love most about Apple is the company's adherence and strive for simplicity. Their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button, not five. Choices can complicate life. A simple gift, that is was Apple has given us in its computers. PC people think that we Mac people are strange. 'The whole world is Windows and you are using a Mac. You poor deluded youth,' someone once told me. I told him he better step back and then began my rant on why Macs reign supreme. I was showing someone a keying shortcut on a Mac (like open Apple and s for save) and explaining the ease and simplicity of Macs and she said 'Oh, they got those shortcuts from Windows.' I said, 'No you didn't' and then explained how Bill Gates just made a PC version of the perfected Mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on. Deluded youth indeed. My cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a PC, which is what she is currently doing. She gets her Mac on at work. It's a far better place at the top of world my friends. Come to the land of milk and Apples, we are a friendly, simple-minded, and visionary bunch. And remember... as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by Apple. *Anna is OK with being in love with her computer."

He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball. He's 6. He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him. While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law. She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt. She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew. During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day). The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail. The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house. I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families. For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time. Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail. This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before. I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent. Richmond is a troubled town. The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month. That is unbelievable to me. Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation. The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related. This makes us feel safer, but should it? I've become desensitized to so much in this town. I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down. I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural. Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me. I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it). I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch. It seems so normal in the schools I teach in. I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing. It causes complacency and this will never help a child. But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?"
495,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year, 'I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...' Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years. The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days. Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.' And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers. I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.' OK, well, anyway, I've got to run. My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes. Wahoowah!"
496,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed. Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house. This is how it went down inside my head: 'Hmm. Why is Best Buy closed? What time is it? It's only 4pm. Oh yeah, Easter. But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees. Why are they all of a sudden holy? More like Best Butt to me. OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams. Target is closed. What the? McDonald's? You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy. What? Oh, Wal-Mart. Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart. Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full. Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave? Nordstrom, good for you. You show them how to fear God, close you store.' Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases. I guess I am now a heathen. Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all. I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty. I didn't even go to church yesterday. This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church. I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints). So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food. OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say. But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser. I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years. Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute."
497,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully). All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London. Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world. After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out. Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months. So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself. There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it. Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went. My family was not pleased AT ALL. My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear? I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared. But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons. So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up. So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it. It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say. I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it. A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone. I've never had that feeling about that trip. My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes. I love it and I must do it. I think I am my best self when I am traveling. I'm an easy traveler. I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan. There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule. I missed the traveling this break. I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due. Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head. Oh well, there are always books to take me there. I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist. I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books. They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney). So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift). So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day. Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release. Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now. Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip. It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious). I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube). So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station. Sometimes, the universe just aligns. And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete."
498,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","And by the devil I mean Uncle Sam. I now have to sell my soul and get a second job. Turns out, I do owe taxes (see 4/3/2004 post). I went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type 'You owe (arrow) {a shitload}.' Thanks Uncle Sam, thanks. The reason why I owe in the first place is because I tutored some kids with Autism last year. And, being the honest taxpayer that I am, I reported all income and expenses and now I owe. That sucks. Honesty, sometimes, not the best policy for my I-really-want-to-go-shopping-but-now-I-have-to-get-another-job self. 'O where o where has my little life gone?' Over the hill to 'Do you need any help or are you just looking?' I'm thinking Barnes and Noble again. I love that place. OK, so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters, but when I walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the Starbucks and the prettiness, oh the prettiness of it all. I love that place. I have to work there, not because I love it, but because I have to, to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and, oh god, will the cycle ever end? Fraid not."
499,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","I hate it when I settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home. There is nothing like a warm-hearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved. I mean my friends are fabulous. They are kind and funny and fun and far away. Distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when I call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home, the loneliness gets deeper. Their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and I go back to what I was doing before the desperate plea for conversation. Tonight, I got 6 messages and 1 number out of service. The latter was a friend of a friend that I've been meaning to have over for dinner, but come on people. Then I think about why I wanted to talk anyway. So much of the time I am just ranting on in my neurotic self-obsessed way and what is in it for them? I hope that I am a good friend, but I know that have my bad moments. One particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information. She is a question asker and she is a lawyer. She asks for more and more info. to the point that I have to stop myself and say 'OK, so what’s up with you?' about 45 mins. into our phone calls. She is great, but she also feeds my self-obsession. She's also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well. Then there is my best friend who's mother is a school counselor, need I say more. While she herself, doesn't have a degree in counseling, she's actually a science nerd, (you know I love you PK) she is fabulous at her second job. And she does this for all her friends. In fact, she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness. Hmmmmm! The immediate lonliness was brought on by my re-watching of my 'Sex And The City' DVDs. I just really miss my girlfriends sometimes. I miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity. My best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 2-24 driving hours away. Oh, the mark of having successful, adventurous, independent women friends! So, I sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place. I think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones. Are they out with other friends? Are they watching a movie? Are they discussing recently read books? Are they organizing fundraisers? Are they laughing? Are they happy? I hope they are laughing. I hope they are happy. They are my friends and I love them."
500,3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James 'Laid' CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to 'Laid' I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music."
